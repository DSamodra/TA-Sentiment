There is nothing like it. The staff were incredibly hospitable nothing was too much trouble, I almost felt like extended family.

In suite check in is a nice touch. As are the generous size suites themselves. I dare you not to get lost in the stunning bathroom or catch an afternoon snooze on your own full size couch.

Firstly the first impression is very modern and a great use of timber in the foyer, plus the roof bar Is amazing to visit for an overall view of Bali. The rooms were weird as you walk through the front door into the bathroom if you are staying in adjoining rooms, and these were both bed rooms, not just one! The balconies are not private and anyone can see you from above if you have your own pool so they have no privacy for intimacy if you are a couple, which is disappointing for those seeking a romantic holiday!

This was rectified the next day by very helpful and attentive staff and we were upgraded to sensational room overlooking beach.

From arrival (registration in the room) the impression given is that nothing is too much trouble. The breakfast is excellent, the resort has a very nice pool and the food quality is very good. The cocktails (happy hour) use local spirits so a marguerita will use tequila made in Jakarta not blue algave Mexican tequila. To have this it is full price. I suggest it is a place for couples rather than family and I recommend a room looking over the sea to the west. Rooms are excellent . Top marks to the management, chefs and staff.; ; ; ;Positive;

We liked the breakfast concept that two times a week there is massive breakfast buffet and for the rest of the week they have a la carte breakfast (order as much as you want). Plenty of healthy options too (if you avocado on toast fan). They also have an amazing western restaurant with a great vibe. The downside: very small number of beach beds and the cocktails in the rooftop bar were the worst we had (no taste at all). Go and enjoy rooftop, but cocktails do need to improve.

Rather than having buffet breakfast you are served a la carte and I can assure you the choices and quality of the food is by far a better option than buffet.

I have just finished reading the negative reviews and realised that most of the people writing them were professional complainers who wanted to stay for free. The butler service is awesome, and the chief butler is a wonderful, extremely helpful lady. My only complaint would be that the gym is WAY too hot and no matter how hard we tried, we couldn‚Äôt turn the temp down either in there nor in our room (the room was comfortable enough). Buffet breakfast is Sunday and Wednesday mornings, and half price cocktails on Thursday evenings (the cocktails and views are outstanding from the rooftop bar!!)

In Bali it is common for the staff to be pleasant and accommodating but the staff at Double Six went beyond what was expected of them any time we requested anything and were extremely professional. The breakfast is a-la-carte instead of buffet but you can order anything you wish and as much as you wish from the menu so everything was fresh and straight from the kitchen.

Bought a deal from Luxury escapes for 8 nights, wish I had bought two. From the very first we were made to feel special. From the very personal welcome and introduction to the hotel, the breakfast in the Italian restaurant everyday, not a buffet, but you could eat your way through the whole delicious menu if you wanted. The Italian restaurant for dinner, the pool bar, the rooftop bar, the pool area, the exemplary cleaning of our room everyday, our personal butler service , there is nothing negative about this place. The staff are wonderful. They are dressed beautifully and the smiles and service are fantastic. The best. It's our last day today :( wishing it was our first. Thank you; ‚Ä¶"; ; ; ;Positive;

The on time airport pick-up service in a luxury car with A/C, cold towels and bottled water? Or maybe the check-in service you can experience either in your car or in your room? Or the Butler you're assigned upon check-in who shows you the featured of your room? This place has it all!! I stayed with a friend for 3 nights in August and we were both in awe as soon as we entered the gates. This brand new property really is unlike anything else. We particularly enjoyed the 125m swimming pool located opposite the beach, and the Spa in which we had a 60 minute massage - which I would highly recommend!!

Our initial 5-star experience with the Double Six Luxury Hotel was via e-mails with Putra the Reservation Supervisor. Always so helpful and professional - nothing was a problem and our accommodation was booked!!! We booked a 2 bedroom Leisure Suite with city views and to our sheer delight we were upgraded to an Oceanview Leisure Suite (416) upon arrival and we were blown away. We were sharing with our daughter and her boyfriend who were already at the Double Six in an Oceanview Leisure Suite and already totally in love with the place. We stay along this ocean strip every time we come to Bali and just love it, so being able to sit on our very own balcony and watch the beach and ocean activity was the best.

It's chic and contemporary design adds to the luxury feeling that the resorts seeks to offer, along with being extremely clean and comfortable.

The reception staff then brought me to the non-wireless eftpos machine that subsequently worked. However the card was charged twice.

Happy Hour drinks there and the pool bar makes it a very reasonably priced place to stay. Rooms are well serviced with many extra amenities.

However, for early risers like us, we tend to be in bed by 8.30-9.00 not matter where we are in the world. The music that echoed from below until 10-10.30pm every night spoilt our experience a little, hence the 4 rating. If the music was good it may have been less bothersome, but seriously this singer was murdering songs with some bad cover renditions. Look, if you are a night owl, 5 stars, forget above comments, it‚Äôs irrelevant. Everything else was great, Plantation Grill, Sunset Bar and Sling Bar are fabulous, poolside area and service was great.
