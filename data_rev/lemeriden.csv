The breakfast had a concise but well executed amount of choice - complete with egg station. Close proximity to the jimbaran beach front restaurants (2 min walk). The housekeeping was a little hit and miss - there were three of us but they only ever left 2 towels and never any face washers or hand towels but that's only a small thing. We were provided with 6 bottles of free water in the room each day and more if required. Enjoyed our stay and would recommend this hotel.

Far beyond our expectations!!,Nice chapel to get married in but upsetting thats it. We were not looked after even though we got married here. The preperation room for a bride and girls is terrible. Lucky i had no guests as i eloped because its dark and boring and its just a mirror and couch not a actual room for bridal photos. Anyway this is not the reason for my complaint. Complaint... I realised my flight was 12am not 12pm lunch time so i ask to extended 1 days accomodation as i got my flight mixed up with planning the wedding and all. So i asked instead of checkout at 12pm lunch can we arrange a room to stay in until 9pm First they said they can not accomodate us.

The room view was either parking lot or pool and seas, the latter would be more expensive. Corridor/access to the room, however, was rather dark and not well lit during the day and the dark stone/tile did not help. Swimming pool was nice, big and warm, but a bit too shallow, perhaps to accommodate kids. Also, given the pool shape, not ideal to do laps on the pool.

A perfect stay!",We stayed in this resort for 3 nights during the low December season. Two things set this resort apart from all other brand name resorts in Jimbaran. One is the contemporary design of the resort - if you are expecting Balinese style design then this is not the resort for you. Instead you are treated to a lobby that is almost like a modern art gallery. It is whimsical and light and the huge rotating fans are almost Salvador Dali like. You will feel like you are in for a fun time. The first night our twin bed was not available so we were given an extra bed at no charge. The other nights we were upgraded to an aqua suite! What a generous gesture! This is one of the perks of being an SPG Gold member - you are highly likely to get such great treatment whenever the resort can; …,Turtle_traveller30 wrote a review Dec 2014,Negative
