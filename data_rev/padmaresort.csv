As someone who had stayed at their sister hotel, Padma Legian, I have high expectations. This is because I had experience first hand the quality of hotels, staff, service there. And after two nights of staying in Padma Ubud, I must say they did not disappoint. We did not expect that the resort will be further - down in Payangan - area. We can see that there's some construction going on because it was not 100% finished yet. And even though the pathway that leads to the hotel was beautiful - we could only imagine how amazing it will be once the trees are big and lush throughout the entire hotel. Yes, we can see some construction. But the friendliness of the staff makes up for it. They were very polite.",Positive

Needless to say staff food pool room views all absolutely amazing. Did not want to leave after 3 glorious nights. If you want to get away in total relaxation in a beautiful jungle setting this is the place. We made one trip into Ubud (40 mins) but could not wait to return to the resort for a great dinner near the pool and a magnificent night swim in the absolutely incredible infinity pool. My wife had 3 treatments in the spa she says it was great to go to a Resort spa and not have to take out a bank loan. The value was fantastic. Overall we can't rate it higher enough.

So we were really glad we'd booked this hotel. It's an oasis of calm surrounded by green jungle, well laid-out and spacious and also refreshingly cool, at least in the evenings, due to its altitude. Admittedly, it's a trek out of Ubud, but that was an advantage as far as we were concerned and we only went in once during our stay. There is plenty to do at the hotel itself - with its amazing, huge infinity pool and the views out over the jungle as you sip on cocktails at the pool bar.

Stayed 3x nights in a Premier Room incl bfst, high tea, dinner and massage. As they only had this offer for two persons in a room... They gave me 2x dinners and 2x massages. I would give 5* for the location and the crazy beautiful infinity pool! If you want to relax by the pool or enjoy the fantastic scenery, this is the place to go. It is far away from everything and it will take a long drive to Ubud. If you need some action or want to go shopping, I suggest you request a free ride to their sister hotel in Legian and make you're own way back to the hotel. Lots of guests divide their stay between the two hotels so a few times a week they will drive to Legian. Do participate in the free cyclingtour",Positive

It is the only resort in the Payangan area so it is very quiet and tranquil. One of the highlights of our stay was undertaking the mixology class with Reznu! We went to the botanical garden first to pick out our fresh ingredients and were served with a welcome drink and canapes before class began. Reznu has a great sense of humour and he made the class very fun and interactive. All the cocktails we created were classics with a twist. We were also presented with a certificate when the class concluded. The resort itself is about 40mins away from the Ubud centre, however, the complimentary shuttle bus provides free wifi, which means you definitely won't be bored.

Simply stunning. Beautiful lobby and landscaped gardens. Really nice connected network of ponds. The pool is simply stunning. Food is very good. Breakfast is great including fresh made coffees. Rooms are tasteful and spacious. All the staff were very nice and great with our kids. Our eldest son enjoyed the kids club. Will definitely stay again. Only critiques are: - on checkout they forgot we were waiting and left us for 20 minutes. Just a human error. - the hotel is isolated with a shuttle bus service to Ubud. Not sure how long it takes as we didn't bother leaving. - The food is reasonably priced but the spa is over priced, almost at Aussie prices. I paid for a 1 hour facial and was only in there 45 minutes.",Positive

The location of the hotel is amazing you could sit on your balcony or poolside all day just enjoying the location itself its breathtaking. The food and drink prices at the resort were very reasonable and not what I would expect from such a new luxury resort, it was a pleasant surprise. The staff are all lovely and go well out of their way to be of any assistance. So relaxing and the pool itself is perfect sun or rain as it is perfectly heated.

They had great deals on and opening room rate specials, which led me to bite the bullet and splurge. I'm so happy to say that this place totally exceeded those high expectations. I booked one room (to sleep three), and that was definitely enough space for three, messy girls. The room was styled with timber and furnished with Balinese decor, and the bathroom had both a large shower and bath. Extra features including the heated towel rack and in-room expresso machine, gave the hotel such a personal and luxurious touch. The pool area and facilities took my breathe away.

From the moment we arrived, up until we left everything is beyond our expectations. We have tried several 5 star resorts but none like this. The staff has been very friendly and helpful throughout our stay. Actually before our arrival, the hotel has already enquired what our preferences are, and the execution was more than what we expected. The room is pleasant and very relaxing. The food - tastes really good (a little bit more local variety meals would be very nice to have. One more thing that all hotels must take note of, the staff treated each and every guest equally, there is no ""bule"" and ""indo"" treatment. In fact, I was pleasantly surprised that the staff were just as friendly to Indonesians as will as to Foreigners. Overall very nice indeed. For whoever",Negative
