We were taken to our room and there he was â€˜our own butlerâ€™ waiting with chilled champagne and refresher towels.

Double 6 is a gem of a hotel offering facilities that will blow your mind. The Seminyak Italian restaurant was scrumptious, the rooms spacious - the bathroom bigger than most peoples lounge rooms, Rooftop is not to be missed and was a highlight of my stay in Bali this time. There is nothing like it. The staff were incredibly hospitable nothing was too much trouble, I almost felt like extended family. That boutiqueness and personal service are much harder to find in much larger impersonal resort brands.

Whether it be the wonderfully designed uniforms the staff greet you in, or their desire to do the very most (and more) for you during your stay; the Double Six are hiring right. In suite check in is a nice touch. As are the generous size suites themselves. I dare you not to get lost in the stunning bathroom or catch an afternoon snooze on your own full size couch.

Firstly the first impression is very modern and a great use of timber in the foyer, plus the roof bar Is amazing to visit for an overall view of Bali. The rooms were weird as you walk through the front door into the bathroom if you are staying in adjoining rooms, and these were both bed rooms, not just one! The balconies are not private and anyone can see you from above if you have your own pool so they have no privacy for intimacy if you are a couple, which is disappointing for those seeking a romantic holiday! The upstairs roof bar seat pits don't have enough room for your feet but look inviting at first.Definately only for those with extremely small feet, or you need to sit sideways.

There is no waiting in reception to check in, this is done in the privacy of your room. The butler arrived a short time later with our welcome drinks and optional shot of vodka. The butler helps unpack bags, takes your ironing and is there 24/7 on call - we really only used the service when we needed it for towels, food, ironing and to have our room cleaned.

From arrival (registration in the room) the impression given is that nothing is too much trouble. The breakfast is excellent, the resort has a very nice pool and the food quality is very good. The cocktails (happy hour) use local spirits so a marguerita will use tequila made in Jakarta not blue algave Mexican tequila. To have this it is full price. I suggest it is a place for couples rather than family and I recommend a room looking over the sea to the west. Rooms are excellent .

Plenty of healthy options too (if you avocado on toast fan). They also have an amazing western restaurant with a great vibe.

The welcome/ departure lounge is a great idea. The food was nice and all the staff were accommodating and polite. The only drawback was the surroundings, which sadly were so noisy and the sound is at a all time high, even with doors closed. So it was not relaxing - but Iâ€™m sure it would appeal to students and party goers. It was a shame as the hotel and amenities were lovely. If I could add video you would be able to hear the level of noise.

My only complaint would be that the gym is WAY too hot and no matter how hard we tried, we couldnâ€™t turn the temp down either in there nor in our room (the room was comfortable enough).

Don't get me wrong, our room is pleasant enough, spacious and clean - although we are situated adjacent to the road where the local dogs and roosters wake you early - not the hotels fault of course, but when the place is nearly empty, perhaps a room further away from the noise or even an upgrade opportunity would have made a difference.

The General Manager seems to be very hands on which is unusual as most hotels I've stayed at the GM is never around. This hotel GM greets her guests as if she is welcoming them into her home. At breakfast she came to ask us if we needed anything extra and if we were enjoying our stay. She approached us again at the pool area on another day and again offered to take care of anything that we may need. A special personal touch. Great service!!!

We had dinner in our room one night and it took over an hour for the food to arrive, our room overlooks the restaurant so we saw the waiter leave with our food, however it turned up 15 minutes later completely cold, by this time it was very late and we didn't have another hour to waste reordering so we ate cold soggy; â€¦"; ; ; ; Le Meriden Bali Jimbaran;0

The staff are excellent, rooms are clean and well maintained and the restaurant is quite good. However, it simply feels that Le Meridien architects have taken an odd shaped piece of land and jammed as many rooms as possible into the space. It is their standard template for hotels and doesn't at all fit into the surroundings or even feel like you are in Bali. A piece of advice - make sure you don't get a room overlooking the car park. There are some lovely rooms that overlook the pool but since we checked in late, we got the only rooms left which have quit a poor outlook.; ; ; ; Le Meriden Bali Jimbaran;1

I have to say, having read the last 10 odd pages of reviews before we arrived I can certainly see where nearly all the reviewers are coming from, this is very much a â€œmarmiteâ€ (or vegemite) hotel, in that there are a lot of things to love and lot of things that are a bit quirky. So Iâ€™ll try list out the proâ€™s and conâ€™s. Pros - Close to the airport (15/20 mins on a quiet run, 30-40 if itâ€™s busy), situated in a quiet fishing village area. - The beach is accessible through a car park at the back of the hotel (maybe 50 yards walk), itâ€™s not a massive hardship and does provide a degree of separation between beach and hotel. - The staff are excellent, as others have reported they; â€¦"; ; ; ; Le Meriden Bali Jimbaran;1

The lagoon pool is only chest deep, kind of hoped for some variation in depth.

Around 12 months old it still feels brand new. The staff were friendly, helpful and welcoming, always with a smile on their faces. I stayed in a room with direct access to the pool from my balcony which was something new and a fun addition to the room. The hotel is located directly behind the famous Jimbaran BBQ seafood restaurants so you don't have far to go for some fresh seafood.

From the moment we arrived nothing was too much trouble and all requests were greeted with a smile. We could not fault the staff or their service. The rooms were amazing, huge and modern we were very comfortable and the resort was away from any noise. The beach was right over the road with restaurants all along the beach. Our flight didn't leave until midnight so the staff allowed us a 4pm checkout with use of the showers in the spa area after 4pm if we needed. The location was great, very peaceful during the day only $6 taxi into Kuta. Not much shopping out that way but very close to pharmacy, mini mart etc. Breakfasts were unbelievable, so much to chose from. We loved our stay at Le Meridien.; ; ; ; Le Meriden Bali Jimbaran;1

Unbelievable service from all staff. The Aqua Suite Lagoon View Room was beautiful and very large. Pool terrific too. Resort is right on Jimbaran beach so two mins walk to fantastic seafood restaurants and perfect sunsets every night. The spa in particular was stunning, especially my masseuse Putri. She did an amazing job. The 150 min package for men with hot stones, scrub and facial is great value and well worth it. Ask for Putri! She is the best!

They recommended a mixed rice restaurant (nasi campur) and when realizing it was lunch time and it would be busy, a staff volunteered to drive over and do take away for me. I am spg platinum and the hotel takes care of its elite guests. Staff remember you by name and I was given a huge suite, and upon having issues with the door, upgraded to an even bigger one.

We told him that our Expedia reservation said ""standard room, view"" and nothing about a paddy view and we wanted the park view.

Maybe it was the way most of the elephants were chained to the ground by a leg around the back perimeter of the park while a few roamed freely around the front where most of the park attendees were. Maybe it was the video playing on repeat in the restaurant touting the park's founders as heroes for ""saving"" the elephants... something about the park just didn't feel right to us... so we left with an uneasy feeling in our guts as we drove back to Ubud."; ; ; ;Mason Elephant Lodge;0

We saw Nigel Mason and he was more than happy to stop and chat. The large majority of these elephants have been rescued so the comments about roaming and mixing are easily explained by there being no matriarchal herd as formed in the wild, 7 males competing in the same area would not happen in the wild or in the â€œhomesâ€ they came from so the fact they are obviously loved by their own individual trainer and extremely well looked after are pure testament to Nigel and his team.

I was concerned about the welfare of the elephants after reading some other reviews but found what I believe to be thirty very well cared for, well loved, extraordinary animals that changed my whole view on elephants - I'm in love! The steel hook people have mentioned is actually blunt and used by some handlers very lightly to direct the animal - some only use their voice or hand but I certainly saw nothing resembling pain or cruelty. I was a bit distressed by one female on a short chain but was told she could harm the other calf kept there if she had free reign.

You get one elephant ride per day, access to the park, which means the show, feeding and interacton with the elephants. Early in the morning you can help wash the elephants. Scrubbing them before they swim. And then you can ride bareback on them as they swim in the water and dunk you a couple times. Very fun.

I asked about why some of the elephants had to be chained to their own pad, and they explained that it was for their own safety and health, as some may not be friendly towards others, and may demonstrate aggressive or destructive behavior. Maybe I just didn't want to believe that this place was cruel to these animals, but anyhow, I had a good time during my stay.; â€¦"; ; ; ;Mason Elephant Lodge;0

Within this tiny space they are all chained by the ankle, to a roughly 8 foot chain, and shackled 24 hours a day. except when they were escorted to play for the tourists, this show was reminiscent of the 1940's where the elephant wore toutous, painted using their trunks, and played football..I do not know exactly what they did as I was too distraught to watch Absolutely jaw droppingly; â€¦"; ; ; ;Mason Elephant Lodge;0

They don't like being categorised as a theme park (although that's the category of tourist award that they display at the check-in). However, the last movement of elephants occurred in 2004 and that traffic is now forbidden by the Indonesian government. There has not been an elephant born here for years.

You can pay for an elephant ride which does bump up the price, but I didn't find it worth it and unfair on the elephants.

It's not a big park and there's not a tons of things to do. You went there to watch, feed, pat, shower the elephants. You could do as much or as little as you'd like.

It is very clear the animals are well taken care of, but it was unsettling to know they are chained up for most of the day.

The room was very comfortable but of course the highlight was getting up close to these beautiful animals. We watched them being bathed and gently cared for by their mahouts who just spoke to them to get them to turn or lie down which the elephants did happily. Going to dinner on an elephant was definitely a highlight, picked up from your room and helped on at a special gate up the stairs.A bumpy ride but am glad to tick it off the bucket list.

After helping scrub the elephants we had the pleasure of riding on their backs while they had their morning swim...what a thrill. Bathers definitely the order of the day. Watch out for the floating coconuts! This was followed by a quick shower, then breakfast. While the breakfast was relatively basic, it was more than adequate.

So I looked into it and found Elephant Safari Park and Lodge in Taro. We had our driver take us out there after stopping in Ubud. Driving to Taro you truly get to see the quiet Balinese villages and their way of life out of the hustle and bustle. The park was cheap for entry but riding an elephant is around $100US per adult. Kids 4 and under are classed as infants so it's pretty cheap. I highly recommend booking online as I think it's a bit cheaper. The park was quite in the afternoon when we arrived.

The resort is approx. 35min from the markets, Monkey Forrest and restaurants / shops but well worth the daily shuttle service to break up resort time and soak in the local less hectic feel of Ubud. Special mention to a few staff that made our stay memorable Gus Oka at the pool bar and the crew of Eko, Slamet, Joni and Wahyu.

The hotel is very far from ubud central. It's about 45 minutes. There are only 4 shuttles running in a day!! (Should be constantly running) the shuttles only run in the times that the city is crowded, which means you can't beat the crowds and arrive to ubud central in the morning.

From flower lei greeting, her warm hug and smile, and birthday cake in my room. She is very meticulous about detail, she knows about my acute asthma and very carefully making sure no bug spray and air freshener in my room. Breakfast and tea time always amazing!

It's unpretentious, generous and friendly. If you are looking for a 'designer' hotel then Padma is not for you, but if you are looking for a comfortable stay with affordable rate then this is a great stay. The rooms are well appointed, proximity between pool and rooms is perfect. For those bringing kids, you can practically leave your kids at the play club for free where they have different programs everyday.

Especially to EKO, I will explain later why. It all started with the pickup, we were staying at The Mulia in Nusa Dua and the butler there contacted Padma staff and the sent for us, for free. The driver was really punctual and friendly he took us yo a Batik store and to a coffee shop. You would like to know that is a 2 hours drive up hill, but it is all worth it when you reach the resort! They welcomed us with drinks and quick check in, showed us our room (4th floor) and invited us to go and get to know the facilities. We were dying to see the pool and the wait was worth it, amazing views of the jungle and perfect temp to dip in. We spent Christmas;;;;Padma Resort Ubud;1

When we first arrive, we were greeted by every staff. Saputro, who helped us with our luggage, informed us of all the resort facilities and gave his business card telling us not to hesitate to call if we need assistance of any kind. The room was perfectly set up with swan towels and roses. Bathtub was a very modern freestanding one, with himalayan salt and rose oil provided. The infinity pool stretch far from one end of the forest to the other, and the pool is heated.

A 'swim up' bar caps off the amazing views There are numerous walking tracks around the resort to explore which can be backed up with a trip to the stunning 'water cave' themed spa treatment rooms. The food is exquisite, from pool snacks to the fine dining experience in the Puhu Restaurant and lounge. The degustation menu (with wines) was fantastic and reasonably priced at $150 AUD for 2 persons. Staff at the resort , and;;;;Padma Resort Ubud;1

If you're up to it, I'd highly recommend renting a scooter in Ubud so that you have freedom to go to town whenever you want - the shuttle to and from Ubud doesn't run as often as I had hoped.

From the first minute we were greeted with smiles and a warm nature and this was prevalent throughout our stay. The rooms and facilities are world class and the activities provided make this hotel a place where you don't have to leave the front gates. These include daily morning yoga, a giant infinity pool, gym facilities, daily free cocktails from 4.30-6.30 in the club lounge and so much more... I strongly recommend the club lounge which gives your stay an extra exclusivity, where Debby and her crew will add the cherry on top of a truely beautiful hotel set amongst a breathtaking backdrop.

It was located between hills and all is green. Really a place for escape from your routine. Especially if you lived in a city like Jakarta. We only stay 1 night so we didn't get the chance to use the spa. They have open air barbecue, but you need to reserve one-day before. Their poolside pizza was great. Parma ham pizza we ordered.

The hotel is spectacular. The most amazing swimming pool and views to die for. The Staff were amazing and couldn't do enough for you.

The hotel provides a free shuttle bus to ubud 5 times which was ideal for us. We wanted to spend some relaxing time at the hotel and go to Ubud in the evening/afternoon.

The food - tastes really good (a little bit more local variety meals would be very nice to have. One more thing that all hotels must take note of, the staff treated each and every guest equally, there is no ""bule"" and ""indo"" treatment.

The deluxe terrace villa (with a private infinity pool) is immensely luxurious and spacious. The highlight of the villa is the private infinity pool which overlooks the beautiful green valley.

Privacy, Luxury, Relaxation, Great food, Stunning views. The Viceroy really jumped out on paper and didnâ€™t disappoint in the flesh. This is by far friendliest place Iâ€™ve ever visited, each member of staff is really pulling for you to enjoy everything during your stay to the full whether thatâ€™s your morning coffee or putting together the biggest day of your life the attitude is the same. Putting together a wedding is usually a stressful operation at the best of times but not here.Even a last minute deconstruction of the whole setting wasnâ€™t too much to ask, they just want you to be happy and we were!

What I found confusing when reading reviews is trying to figure out where the hotels were relative to the town of Ubud and which ones were truly the best. After reading loads of reviews we settled on Viceroy. I could not have made a better choice. From the VIP service at the airport (make sure you request this), to the friendliness of the staff, to the location, to the extraordinary accommodation and superb food, this is the Best of Bali. We had a Terrace Villa which I would highly recommend over the garden villa. Everything about the room, plunge pool, bathroom and the public spaces of the Viceroy are exceptional.

They were very thoughtful and even left petals in our bath for our last night. Our room was beautiful we had a Deluxe villa with a pool, from the smell of the room to the amazing dÃ©cor we could not find one fault.
