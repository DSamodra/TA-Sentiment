For people less familiar with Bali, it is a high end Ubud boutique hotel; there are about 4-6 similar ones around Ubud, such as the Alila or the Hanging Gardens. Hotels around Ubud provide the rice terrace / mountain type holiday feel, whereas Kuta, Seminyak and most other well known suburbs in Bali typically are the more ""Beach type"" places.

Everything about this hotel is first class from the food, to the staff, to the facilities, to our gorgeous villa (#10). Highly recommended. And if you’re looking for Bali drivers/tour guides, I can’t recommend these two gentlemen enough. From the time you step off the plane until the time you leave, they give top notch service. Always on time, always going above and beyond and ALWAYS service with a smile. Gusti: WhatsApp +62 821-4770-7270 Jony: WhatsApp +62 878-6117-7773", ,Positive

The hotel has thought about some of the little things that other hotels sadly miss (e.g. shuttles in Ubud when you want to go and just call to be picked up - not a timetable). Food and wine top notch too. Paradise is not an exaggeration. A perfect place to wind down and relax.; …",First class!,Positive

The gardens and grounds al perfectly presented and so peaceful and relaxing in the whole resort. Big cudos to having a coffee maker and iPod player in each villa, the bathroom was huge and had nice deep bath and large shower with two vanities, the downside being the bath oils/soaps were not very nice in fact both myself and a friend who stayed in another villa at Viceroy thought they smelt pretty awful.

How to put the right words here to describe. We started our trip in a private Villa in Seminyak so set the bar high, however after 4 days we were hanging out to get to serene and beautiful Ubud. Can only say that ""The Viceroy"" blew our minds. The staff were fantastic, the food 1st class, the view over the valley and paddy fields divine. Their own website does not do them justice. We stayed in the Garden Villa and our only possible complaint (if you could call it one) was the water in our private pool was a bit too fresh (cool). With only 11 villa's in the complex, there's no overcrowding and the staff made us feel more than at home. Would thoroughly recommend The Viceroy to anyone who is considering it, as we'll definitely be going back.",Two weeks in a haven of peace,Positive

Its everything and more one could hope for a peacful oasis. As travellers to luxury resorts around the world, we are hard to impress. But The Viceroy did indeed impress us beyond words. Its hard to put into words how luxurious the Villas are, the scenery and resort does not photograph as well as the eye sees it up close. You have to stay there, its amazing you wont be dissapointed.The restuarant is the best meal we had whilst in Bali, the staff genuinely sincere. Margaret the Managing Director is a truelly lovely Aussie, very welcoming and extremely helpful for anything you require. She made the stay even more personable. We will absolutely return again and again",R&amp;R Heaven,Positive

Tucked away in the beautiful jungle of Ubud, Bali, this hidden gem is the ultimate peaceful 5 star experience. I love boutique hotels, but this was surreal. Not just from the views, but the wonderful hospitality. My parents had stayed here for their 25th anniversary, so I booked myself a stay for my 30th birthday and it was the perfect way to relax!! The Lembah Spa is wonderful, Cascade's and Aperitif restaurants are delicious, and each villa is superb. The best part was having our own private pool and gazebo in our villa, where we didn't need to be at the main pool. Aside from each room having their own private pool, the coolest feature is the helicopter pad that can pick you up from the airport!

It's situated at the top of a valley with views of a working rice paddy across the valley. The pool is incredible, as is the food ...albiet rather gourmet for us simple Aussies. The room was something else entirely, and possibly the most beautiful hotel room we're likely to stay in for quite some time. There was a plunge pool on the terrace of the villa with an outside bathroom. A word to the wise, don't leave the outdoor bathroom lights on while you're out... the bugs go crazy. Everyone was very friendly and professional. The hotel was perfect for us, on our honeymoon, as it was completely quite. Everyone has a sense of quiet about them, even the guests which was lovely.

The bathrooms alone will knock you out! Seriously killer rooms. We had our own private pool and the kids had a suite next to ours with their own private pool. I think all villas come with them. Dirty little secret of private pools: Not heated. So think of them more as a water feature. The main pool however, wow. The pictures I took in this place were spectacular enough to inspire us to have a book made. Really. The owner is on property and super cool, friendly guy. Austrian. The food was just ok. We are adventurous diners and even ate the famous suckling pig, but ah, just ok. Can't recommend this place enough.

We came here for our honeymoon and were blown away with the beauty of the place and above all, the fantastic service and perks, having booked as honeymoon guests.

The service really was impeccable, and they couldn’t do enough for us.
