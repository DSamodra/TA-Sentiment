The front desk staff told us that we had a paddy view room in the opposite side of the park behind the restaurant and the shop (can't see elephants, difficult to access swimming pool and breakfast). We told him that our Expedia reservation said ""standard room, view"" and nothing about a paddy view and we wanted the park view. He then brought out a list of pricing (only valid until March even though we went in April) wanting to charge us $700 for the park view room. If you look at the list, the ""standard room"" is listed apart from paddy view, garden view, and park view so there is no logic whatsoever beyond a sorry attempt; …", ,Negative

I can't put my finger on it, but after less than an hour something made us want to leave. Maybe it was the way most of the elephants were chained to the ground by a leg around the back perimeter of the park while a few roamed freely around the front where most of the park attendees were. Maybe it was the video playing on repeat in the restaurant touting the park's founders as heroes for ""saving"" the elephants... something about the park just didn't feel right to us... so we left with an uneasy feeling in our guts as we drove back to Ubud.", ,Negative

We were highly recommended to go here and experience their romantic candle lit dinner under the stars while getting a tour and ride on the elephants. Although the park was beautiful it was small and the tour did not take very long. We were given an hour free time in which we could visit the shop or buy a drink. This time was slightly unnecessary as there wasnt a lot for us to do. The actual riding of the elephants was great and our guide was very friendly and funny.

Interesting to find out about the different elephants and their backgrounds. Each elephant has an individual trainer and someone to care for them.

I had my hesitations about going somewhere like this--you always hear about how cruel they are to the animals. I have to say I was very pleasantly surprised. Our guide was talking to us a lot when we went on our elephant ride and told us how he and the elephant (Rama) ended up there. They rescued Rama from Sumatra where he was being hunted for his tusks. We noticed that Rama only had one tusk and that was the reason why. Our guide has been with Rama for almost 20 years and moved his whole family to Bali when Rama came to the Elephant Park.

People were literally queuing at each elephant for this. Other elephants were taking tourists for a ride and you could also see the elephants take part in a “show” where no doubt they were bullied into doing unnatural tricks for the amusement of humans.

You should all be ashamed of yourselves mason lodge. I’m so angry I spent over £160 for the two of us on this “experience” it was like a cattle market. The poor elephants chained up (and there is no explanation you could give for this) they don’t do this in a proper sanctuary (Thailand) you are carted from one shoddy thing to another. I’m sure the elephants don’t even want to be scrubbed down. Riding the elephants in the water is poor. I refused to do this when I saw the handlers pick axing the poor animals on their heads when they wanted it to do certain things. In closer inspection you can see the scarring on their poor heads.

My first visit was Thailand. While in Thailand, I was able to spend a day at a true elephant sanctuary where the elephants are free to roam, they are not put to work, they were not chained, and they weren’t bombarded by flocks of tourists. When I decided to visit Bali, I was excited to visit with the elephants again. My friend came across the Mason Elephant Park. We checked out the reviews and decided to make a reservation to feed and wash the elephants. We made our reservation directly through their website which was very easy. We had quick replies and all questions answered.the park has its own drivers and they picked us up in a private car at our hotel in Sanur to transport us to the park.

The elephants including the baby elephants were chained to concrete pads when they were either not giving rides or performing in a patronising show . In speaking with the handlers ( who obviously care deeply ) they confirmed that the elephants have no time EVER to roam freely or socialise with the other elephants .

I believe some people may be under a false impression of how the elephants are treated. When unsupervised the elephants are chained and have their own paddocks to freely roam. They are big, wild animals and because there are far more males in the group than is natural they do fight. If the elephant has his or her handler then they can roam freely. Each elephant has their own ""hooman"". This man (I didn't see any women, though there may be women hoomans) dedicates his life to his elephant. The elephants do not share hoomans, and they all have one. These men spend years of their life; …",Date of stay: October 2016,Negative

Our children loved it, especially climbing on the elephants’ backs and going in the water. It did feel a bit like a conveyor line - through scrubbing the elephants to then getting in with them. I also felt a little pressurised to tip all the elephant handlers. I did not like seeing all the elephants chained up and clearly bored - rocking back and forth. They are in the process of building a ‘free-range’ are which should hopefully help with this. I left with mixed feelings - these are elephants that have been rescued and they do have a successful breeding programme, but I’m not sure the elephants have a great life here :-(.

The Elephant safari was great, we rode an elephant (Rhonda) around a small jungle track and then through a pool at the end. You could easily do white water rafting (morning), monkey forest and then elephant safari in one day if you left early from Seminyak, although we decided to stay in Ubud for one night and do Elephant/White Water rafting on day 1 and monkeys quickly on day 2 before being picked up by a (free) shuttle back to Sanur for a boat ride across to Nusa Lembongan for 3 nights (highly recommend this place too).", ,Positive

The elephants are all chained up and can barely move. A lot of the elephants were pacing on their chains. The chains were so short. When I asked why they were chained they said it was because they fight and for their safety. I don't believe this to be true. Also if they did fight they could just put them in separate pens rather then chain every elephant to a tiny circle. They also use hammers to control the elephants which wasn't very nice. I think the elephants are treated better here then in other elephant parks in Asia but it wasn't nice to see them pacing with extremely short chains :(,Date of stay: May 2017,Negative

The handlers are gentle and knowledgeable. The elephants are ravenous for sweet potatoes, carrots and fruit. Having an elephant adeptly and gently take a piece of a carrot out of your hand is pretty amazing. Being able to brush and run your hands along the flank of a 3 ton elephant who is unchained is magical.
