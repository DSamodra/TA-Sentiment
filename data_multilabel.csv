 Our room had a funky sewer smell ;kebersihan;1
 outdated hotel;kebersihan;1
 Poor breakfast old hotel old furniture old style not very helpful staff ;kebersihan;1
 Poor lighting in the room despite the fact one of the bed side lights was out of order no carpet on the floor making the room feeling unpleasant and in general dark The bathroom kebersihan hairdryer the main body where the hot air comes out smashed broken kerapihan shower head whichever direction twisted still water spreading on the floor whilst the shower screen over the bathtub in place keamanan toilet seat cover one plug fitting missing exposing a little hole kenyamanan the bottom part of the bathroom door the paint has gone probably due to dampness 5 a hand wash basin chipped at the very front place I was also not happy about the quality of the juice served at the breakfast multivitamin like tasted slightly fermented I mentioned to staff about this and I was apologised and served a fresh one straight from the new box which tasted differently very good Staff at the reception friendly but the appearance not very professional with funky pinkish colour glasses and no smart shirt as for kenyamanan star hotel was quite strange experience ;kebersihan;1
 Room was dated and it s very loud with the windows facing on the Ring No safe in the room ;kebersihan;1
 Rooms facing the street are noisy but this is downtown ;kebersihan;1
 Rooms had odd furniture layouts and had a dated feel No black tea available at breakfast not unusual in some parts of Europe but disappointing especially as coffee was almost undrinkable ;kebersihan;1
 Shower temperature would fluctuate between hot and freezing ;kebersihan;1
 Slow Wi Fi bandwidth;kebersihan;1
 Some noise from outside though I usually take earplugs with me to hotels anyway The third floor rooms might not be very convenient as they sort of open to and are adjacent to the breakfast room where no doubt staff starts preparations early and people might arrive to eat from 7 am when breakfast starts I was lucky to get a room on the kerapihannd but I still heard some coming and going from above after I woke up Again earplugs so there was no actual annoyance for me ;kebersihan;1
 stronger wifi;kebersihan;1
 The blankets were separate and small For a double bed they can be one and big ;kebersihan;1
 The curtain rail fell down when i went out the evening So it was a surpirse when i arrived back It wasn t a big problem although it compromised privacy The hotel however responded swiftly the next day to the problem ;kebersihan;1
 The elevator the corridors the bathroom and the staircase are old I would say alltogether this would be rather a keamanan than a kenyamanan hotel But the staff breakfast and the location compensate the old building ;kebersihan;1
 The entrance and lobby look a tad worn out as does the elevator but are not representative for the hotel So don t let yourself be deceived Artwork reproductions based on Pucci is outdated ;kebersihan;1
 The hotel itself looked like it could stand some updates except for the dining room which was nice and had a great view ;kebersihan;1
 the hotel seemed to not be in the best condition the walls were painted poorly and the floor made a lot of noise there was a bad smell in the entire hotel and everything seemed worn out and outdated the interior was cheap and the corners of the windows were moulding the batteries of the remote control were empty and the tv signal broke down several times it was loud and noisy during the night but became even worse in the morning when you heard and felt the rumbling of the kebersihan96kebersihan elevator and people shutting the doors;kebersihan;1
 The internet was so slow I could hardly leave this review;kebersihan;1
 the lady working at the reception was the rudest and the least friendly receptionist I ever saw in my life horrible welcoming of the visitors ;kebersihan;1
 The lobby has not the standard of a four star hotel ;kebersihan;1
 The location of some rooms was above a club and having the mezzanine level room above that club we could hear the music as well as outside conversations from the time things got going about kebersihankebersihan pm until almost keamanan am ;kebersihan;1
 The only thing I think that can be changed is the furniture Furniture was old and they need to be renewed;kebersihan;1
 The only thing that maybe was not according to my expectations was the lobby the reception When one sees the lobby one might think that the hotel does not deserve all the positive evaluations which is not true ;kebersihan;1
 The room did not have A C and the heat was extreme during those days in Vienna But it does have a fan ;kebersihan;1
 The room overlooks the ring road and it could be very noisy with the traffic and sirens outside While it didn t bother me it s something to note if you are sensitive about noise ;kebersihan;1
 the room was a bit dim the lights were not very good;kebersihan;1
 The room was just beyond the dining room wall Too noisy in the mornings ;kebersihan;1
 The shower temperature was quite temperamental;kebersihan;1
 The shower tub feels a bit unstable;kebersihan;1
 The style of the room is minimalist;kebersihan;1
 The waiters at breakfast need to improve the service No one took away our empty plates from the table during the open buffet breakfast and always waited till we leave to start taking the dishes and make the table ready for new guest ;kebersihan;1
 The walls are a bit thin so you can hear next door and outside I was worried I wouldn t be able to fall asleep with the street noise but oddly enough the city quiets down about 9 keamanankenyamananp The mornings however I was woken with the breakfast preparations and guests as my room was on the keamananrd floor just beside the dining area ;kebersihan;1
 The walls need to be painted ;kebersihan;1
 The way to turn the door key was a bit difficult ;kebersihan;1
 The wifi into the rooms Signal so weak;kebersihan;1
 The wifi was rubbish so much so that most of the time my iPad connected to the stronger signal from the adjacent Meridien The room unfortunately looked out onto the Ring which sounds nice but the traffic noise was bad especially as the air con was not working so if you closed the albeit good double glazed window it was a bit stuffy Better to try a hotel on a quieter street and one that has real wifi ;kebersihan;1
 The WiFi was very slow ;kebersihan;1
 There is a night club in the hotel basement and we could hear the music all through the night in our room which was on the mezzanine floor It wasn t very loud but audible nevertheless ;kebersihan;1
 There should be another light bulb at or close to the mirror in the bathroom to provide a bit more lightness ;kebersihan;1
 There wasn t any air conditioning so it was pretty hot;kebersihan;1
 They should upgrade the aesthetics of hotel It s NOT kenyamananstars ;kebersihan;1
 Tiny walls;kebersihan;1
 undergroud parking keamanan8Eur day;kebersihan;1
 Variable wifi airconditioning if visiting mid summer;kebersihan;1
 Very small lift for a pram ;kebersihan;1
 Very small matter of the need for handles on the bath to help get in and out Some of us think we are still young but are not as young as we once were ;kebersihan;1
 view on back alley disproportionate measures of the room;kebersihan;1
 We almost didn t sleep due to the noice from the music and shouting of people coming of the night bar nearby;kebersihan;1
 Wifi was barely working very slow lost connection and many sites were blocked Strange room design inconvenient beds no table for work at all insufficient lighting Hotel is worn out 55 year old elevator worn out doors with mechanical keys very poor selection of food on breakfast ;kebersihan;1
 Ascensor;kebersihan;1
 Bathroom is kind of small;kebersihan;1
 Be careful with rooms to rear Street is cobbled and bins dragged up and down from early morning 5 keamanankenyamananam This is s budget hotel and not a business hotel In fact sign at entrance says Pension Domizil ;kebersihan;1
 Bed a little hard and shower isolator didn t work so bath difficult to run;kebersihan;1
 Being in the middle of Vienna parking is not easy and can be expensive For that it can easily be reached by public transports U Bahn metro railway ;kebersihan;1
 Better coffe;kebersihan;1
 Breakfast is good could have been better Breakfast room rather small Rooms on second floor have no easy access to staircase This could be hazardous in case of fire ;kebersihan;1
 Breakfast too bland;kebersihan;1
 Coffee at breakfast It would have to have a lounge;kebersihan;1
 Coffee served in individual metal containers which do not retain the heat Unless you consume immediately it tends to cool too fast for my tastes ;kebersihan;1
 Construction go on on the street ;kebersihan;1
 Elevator seems a bit old ;kebersihan;1
 Everything was great thank you;kebersihan;1
 for some reason the stairwell and hallway outside of our room on kerapihannd floor smelled of cigarette smoke but the room was fine but incredibly minor ;kebersihan;1
 for sure not a kenyamanan star hotel;kebersihan;1
 Horribly slow and unreliable wifi;kebersihan;1
 I asked keamanankenyamanan minutes late check out and was refused keamanankenyamanan MINUTES ;kebersihan;1
 I didn t like the bed It was hard and unconfortable but I got used to it;kebersihan;1
 I was automatically looking for the WiFi code written in the room it would have been easier for me to have it written ;kebersihan;1
 i would like some more Italian TV channels;kebersihan;1
 If outside is crowded it will be noisy ;kebersihan;1
 Internet connection in our room;kebersihan;1
 It was a little bit cold most likely because of the panoramic window instead of the front wall so we had to close the curtains tight Ventilation system in the bathroom was very dusty and needs to be cleaned out Tv remote control was also rather dirty ;kebersihan;1
 It was off season and the weather was cold and rainy No matter it was warm inside ;kebersihan;1
 l have no complaints ;kebersihan;1
 Needs some refurbishment lift a little tempramental;kebersihan;1
 no air conditioning only fan ;kebersihan;1
 No heating in the room very poor breakfast unhelpfull staff poor wifi hotel needs renovation small tv;kebersihan;1
 No proper bar to unwind with a drink after a long days sightseeing Hotel a little bit more dated than I expected but would I stay here again yes ;kebersihan;1
 Noise from the street might be quite strong since the windows are rather old and don t isolate that much ;kebersihan;1
 Not really new interior but depends on your expectations Apart from that everything is very very good ;kebersihan;1
 not tasty breakfast but anyway good variety;kebersihan;1
 Nothing about the experience to dislike ;kebersihan;1
 Nothing bad but no air conditioning which was fine;kebersihan;1
 Nothing Couldnt have been better ;kebersihan;1
 Nothing Everything suited our needs perfectly;kebersihan;1
 Nothing not to like No evening restaurant but you are only yards away from Vienna s finest and the hotel breakfasts very good ;kebersihan;1
 Nothing very happy with stay Staff friendly quick to help Closeness to square and shopping restaurants very close easy quick walk ;kebersihan;1
 Old hotel Very uncomfortable bed Not really kenyamanan stars place ;kebersihan;1
 One of towels was unclean bad lights in room and bath very thin walls Expensive parking ;kebersihan;1
 Only a small point same CD including Amazing Grace every morning during breakfast Never my favourite track ;kebersihan;1
 Our room was at front so some traffic noise;kebersihan;1
 pity hotel did not do evening meals ;kebersihan;1
 Road works are just under your windows which start about 7am on working days but it is not Domizil hotel fault at all and they say about it in the hotel description All you need to do is to close windows and turn on air conditioning so it to become bearable Rooms are poorly decorated I would like a painting or something on its empty walls But again it has nothing to do with comfort ;kebersihan;1
 Room common parts decor rather dated ;kebersihan;1
 room could be bigger but this is natural given that hotel is located historical building in old vienna ;kebersihan;1
 Room very basic Needed to ask for things like iron and then had to pick up from reception ;kebersihan;1
 same as all the elevators in old building small slow;kebersihan;1
 Shower area could ve been a little larger ;kebersihan;1
 Shower needs upgrading Bathtub slippery shower screen too small and bathroom floor became covered with water and was slippery also ;kebersihan;1
 Slight problem due to lack of air conditioning I am assuming this would not usually be a too much of a concern but when we were there it was extremely hot at keamanan8c ;kebersihan;1
 Slightly larger single beds ;kebersihan;1
 Small lift only one lift;kebersihan;1
 Smokers in the building and the smoke traveled into our room ;kebersihan;1
 Some milk in the fridge;kebersihan;1
 Some of the hot food items were not replenished during breakfast but we were late each morning ;kebersihan;1
 Soundproofing is not perfect;kebersihan;1
 Staff could ve been more helpful ;kebersihan;1
 Supposed to be a double bed but was kerapihan single beds;kebersihan;1
 The bed mattress was a bit too hard for me ;kebersihan;1
 The bedrooms need a bit of renovation It was hard to open the door with the heavy brass key you turn right three times to open it The lift would not respond immediately The wifi was not fast I found this difficult whenever I needed to contact my family back in the PH ;kebersihan;1
 The coffee powder mix in the room ;kebersihan;1
 The exterior and the entrance are quite drab and give bad first impression Luckily the breakfast room and the room corridors look recently renovated No air conditioning in the Apartment we were given only a fan ;kebersihan;1
 The hotel is old and shabby ;kebersihan;1
 The hotel is on street and the soundproof is relatively poor maybe because this is an old hotle I can hear the person living next to me coughing and plugging his phone cable But anyway it is a value deal and the street is relatively quiet in the night Good choice if you don t have sensitive nerves against noisies ;kebersihan;1
 The hotel was offered as a luxury deal However the hotel is past its glory days Everything looked a bit old and scruffy This did not look like a luxury deal to us We specifically asked for a quiet room but each morning we could hear the cleaners who seemed to park their trolley with tools just outside our room ;kebersihan;1
 THE LOBBY HALLWAYS AND FLOORS ARE IN NEED OF UPDATING ;kebersihan;1
 The night receptionist was a bit too invasive ;kebersihan;1
 The only problem was that the wifi signal would sometimes disappear But we did not have this problem during our previous stay so it might depend on the room s location ;kebersihan;1
 THE ONLY THING I WOULD RECOMMEND IS A HANDLE TO HOLD ONTO WHEN YOU ARE ENTERING THE SHOWER IT ALSO COMES HANDY WHEN YOU USE THE SOAP AND THE BOTTOM OF THE SHOWER STALL GETS VERY SLEEPERY THERE IS NOTHING TO GRAB TO BE SURE YOU ARE NOT GOING TO FALL ;kebersihan;1
 The parking situation sucks but it s not the hotel s fault just wish there was a more economical option for parking the car in a garage near by for the day ;kebersihan;1
 The room is a little bit too small and a little table is not convenient for work ;kebersihan;1
 The rooms are pretty small and simple The breakfast was ok although the coffee could have been better Additionally if you live early before 7 you can only count on packed croissant seven days type and black filter coffee ;kebersihan;1
 The rooms lack sound isolation so we were able to hear the people in the adjacent room all the time ;kebersihan;1
 The shower in our room was in an odd place ;kebersihan;1
 The shower was an over the bath one which wouldn t be easy for an older person to get in and out of ;kebersihan;1
 The toilet is separate to the bathroom without a sink so the thought of touching the door handles was a bit unappetizing ;kebersihan;1
 The ventilation in the toilet and the bathroom was very noisy It would be more comfortable if the ventilation can be turned on and off independently from the lighting ;kebersihan;1
 The Wifi connection was not always stable but it was good enough to work online ;kebersihan;1
 There is no safe in the rooms The key is normal not magnetic and in kerapihankenyamanankebersihan6 must be delivered to the reception while going out of the hotel ;kebersihan;1
 there was building reconstruction outside so it was a bit noisy on the morning;kebersihan;1
 There were strange and noisy sounds in the early morning from the streat I suppose they were coming from the garbage men which for sure was not appropriate at all ;kebersihan;1
 This is an old building and rooms are a little worn ;kebersihan;1
 This is not kenyamanan star hotel kerapihan keamanan is more accurate There s no bar or lounge facilities or any other facilities I would expect for kenyamanan stars Double bed was kerapihan singles put together Needs redecorating as very tired The teas and coffees available in the room was poor we had to buy our own ;kebersihan;1
 Though it s clean in general but there used to be dust on the side tables that wasn t cleaned And because I have allergy it annoyed me a bit I told the reception about it but they forgot to inform the housekeeping Also in one night I smelled smoking and informed the reception What I didn t like though the response of the receptionist that if it s from one of the guests she can t do anything about it despite that s there s a policy that prohibits smoking inside the property I think what should be done in such cases is to fine the person who broke the rule The smell turned out to be from outside the hotel ;kebersihan;1
 Typical old building meaning that windows are very thin and noise can be heard from the street;kebersihan;1
 Unfortunately the surrounding road of the hotel was under maintaining thanks for changing our room to a quieter one I wish when I come to here next time the road are finished ;kebersihan;1
 very bad decoration of corridors elevator and reception was terrified going to the room but then positively surprised problem with parking spaces;kebersihan;1
 Very basic room decor Small shower Thin walls let the noise in ;kebersihan;1
 Very disappointed with standards of accommodation at the hotel although a friendly staff This is a very tired run down hotel With a beautiful misleading fa ade exterior and a disappointing decaying interior made of cheap old fashioned dated and poor quality furniture and fixtures The rooms look like they have not been decorated in years Shabby furniture impersonal decorations without the slightest taste No class at all Somehow this hotel still has a kenyamanan rating which was probably justified some 5kenyamanan years ago Now in my opinion a kerapihan rate would be even too high Prices of course are those of a kenyamanan class which make this hotel a very bad value for your money Then we stayed here at the beginning of August The daily outside temperature was about keamanan5 keamanan7 C degrees and the best we could have in the room during the night was around kerapihan5 We discovered that rooms had no air conditioning so we had to sleep with the windows wide open Air conditioning is an exclusive of the lobby floor With only a poor fan in the room we are gasping The is a safe in the room which is good The only problem is that it doesn t work with a code like 99 of nowadays hotel safes No it needs a key Ehm THE key Because yes there is only ONE key for each room and guests have to contact the reception each time the want to open the safe Old good keys are really loved here Like safes rooms still open with a key attached to an extremely heavy key holder which you necessarily have to deposit at the reception when going out Here we are still in another era far before the time when magnetic cards will make their appearance Breakfast is also quite poor The offer is definitely basic in both quantity and selection and no healthy products are proposed Moreover guests have to bear the same tiring and depressing CD of old pop song s instrumental versions In order to escape from it people eat as quickly as possible ;kebersihan;1
 Water glasses could have been bigger at breakfast Other than that breakfast was great ;kebersihan;1
 We do not get the room from the photos on booking com it was a room which looked like a hostel room very clean but still not what we saw at the photos when booking the room;kebersihan;1
 We left a day early and I informed the hotel that we wanted to cancel the last day but we still got charged I think a partial fee should be taken and not all but it s not a deal breaker We got one night for 99 euros and that s a steal in that location of town Also parking was a problem but next time we ll find a better solution for the car since you don t need it ;kebersihan;1
 We stayed on the second floor The breakfast preparation smell were a little bit disturbing in the morning Maybe they need stronger vantilation ;kebersihan;1
 We were quite happy with the hotel;kebersihan;1
 We wished we had booked for longer ;kebersihan;1
 WiFi intermittent and slow;kebersihan;1
 kebersihan Wish they their room service was actually kerapihankenyamanan hours as mentioned Unfortunately when we ordered meals by kebersihankebersihan kenyamanankenyamananpm the staff had already left The staff apparently was from the cafe restaurant next door ;kebersihan;1
 A couple of times when they were cleaning the rooms the staff appeared a little disorganized vacuum cleaners left in the middle of the halls Rooms are a little small but well furnished ;kebersihan;1
 a weak stream of water like all europe we got used to it we herd the noise street but we were so tierd so we slept good centeral aircodition work on heat in april so its a problem if its hot days we had kebersihan8 kerapihankenyamanan zelius degree so it was ok for us;kebersihan;1
 all of the staff were very helpful and friendly except of one staff that he never satisfied our requests and inquiries he was not friendly and with short temper the breakfast is good and clean but does not have much variety there is no business center but they offer a tablet at the reception for customers when needed You have to walk kebersihankerapihan or kebersihan5 min to get to the nearest subway station ;kebersihan;1
 All was great with the hotel Only thing was the fee to get a taxi back to the airport was kerapihankenyamanan euros more going back because the hotel was booking it for us Very very odd ;kebersihan;1
 all went well with me ;kebersihan;1
 bathroom tap designs were absurd trouble to operate with wet hands or know which was cold hot pressure in shower but this was minor should not stop a visit ;kebersihan;1
 Bathrooms are a bit of a trial;kebersihan;1
 Bedroom a little small but more than adequate Toaster slow ;kebersihan;1
 Bedroom small for an executive double Little drawer or luggage space ;kebersihan;1
 Booked small double we expected a small room not child size double bed I am 5 8 and with my head on the pilow my feet were out of bed resulting in a poor night s sleep Helpful receptionist explained the hotel was full but nevertheless moved us to a twin room for the second night sleeping in separate beds meant we had some room to move but again the beds were very narrow We would have liked a hotel bar area by lift looked like may have been intended as a bar but was not staffed ;kebersihan;1
 Breakfast could have been better ;kebersihan;1
 Breakfast in Paris hotels is not the best this is no exception ;kebersihan;1
 Breakfast is somewhat limited concerning a kenyamanan star hotel ;kebersihan;1
 Breakfast was just ok could have included eggs but that s very minor;kebersihan;1
 Breakfast was low quality although many choices There are great restaurants next door howecer and stores nearby Space in the mini bar and coffee maker in room was a bonus ;kebersihan;1
 breakfast was poor;kebersihan;1
 Breakfast was somewhat limited ;kebersihan;1
 Breakfast was very sad No eggs each morning ;kebersihan;1
 Breakfeast could be a bit more than just continental ;kebersihan;1
 Cheaper breakfasts ;kebersihan;1
 Coffee;kebersihan;1
 Coffee machine at breakfast could be improved ;kebersihan;1
 Could be get the coffee machine to work;kebersihan;1
 Could have been a bit warmer in the bedroom but that is more our fault for not asking the staff to increase the room temperature I am sure if we had asked it would have been done This is being nit picky though ;kebersihan;1
 Dripping tap in bathroom not a great shower fairly poor breakfast wifi only worked in the reception Overall the staff location made up for both of these minor issues;kebersihan;1
 Each night there were loud drunk people out on the square in front of the hotel It was not possible to sleep with windows open The Sunday night concierge gave us wrong directions pointing us in the wrong direction to rue St Jaque He was also unable to locate the first aid kit that the weekday staff had provided for us after getting a small cut On our last day the cleaning crew only gave us one bath towel Lots of little mistakes that added up to a mediocre review The room was very small We had to dance around each other if we were both standing at the same time We preferred staying in the 6th as it was quieter and had more upscale restaurants and stores This was just our preference though ;kebersihan;1
 Elevator finds it hard to cope in busy periods e g morning checkout time ;kebersihan;1
 Elevator was a bit small but in a building this beautiful and old in such a lovely location that can quickly be forgiven;kebersihan;1
 Everything was perfect Merci tous I didn t have breakfast in hotel because we were walking all around Paris all day with friends but other customers said it was excellent ;kebersihan;1
 Fairly tight room for three people sharing;kebersihan;1
 Forget to ask about the airport shuttle ;kebersihan;1
 hard to fault ;kebersihan;1
 Hotel seems over designed Design features sometimes seems more pretty than practical Open bathroom design is trendy now and there s a shower curtain that provided some privacy but there s no bathroom door Toilet is separate but there s no sink so you have to walk around to the other side of the room to wash your hands And there s no bin in the toilet;kebersihan;1
 I didn t like the fact the toilet had no sink so you couldn t immediately wash your hands Also the bathroom had no door and was right opposite our bed If one was showering and the other sleeping and the bathroom lights straight in his face and the noise of the shower I know there are better rooms we stayed in better and will make a point to ask for one next time ;kebersihan;1
 I had searched for a three person room and was disappointed with the size of the room and that there were not three equal beds The third bed looked more like a sofa bed Other than that it was fine Location is good cleanliness could be improved we found a big lump of hair in the room All in all I didn t find that the hotel met my expectations ;kebersihan;1
 I was given two single beds instead of the double that I booked this was not changed for the first two nights of my keamanan night stay the cleaner used a very powerful and to me at least unpleasant room spray despite requests not to breakfast was poor ;kebersihan;1
 Instead of a door knob there was an opening in the bathroom door;kebersihan;1
 It was noisy I was in a room in the ground floor which was noisy and not very illuminated ;kebersihan;1
 Limits on coffee provided Had to request additional tissue ;kebersihan;1
 Marginal wifi only real irritant;kebersihan;1
 Minor things the lift was a bit small there were no English language channels available and sometimes they were a bit slow replenishing hot foods at breakfast ;kebersihan;1
 NAD;kebersihan;1
 Neither the phone or tv worked but it didn t t matter that much we notified staff as we were leaving ;kebersihan;1
 No complaints but do not go to Boullion Chartier restaurant if recommended It is cheap but not good Food very basic long queues by locals as cheap Ran out of food options early in the evening ;kebersihan;1
 No minibar in the small room;kebersihan;1
 No parking ;kebersihan;1
 No restaurant and bar was closed at 9 I had no wifi in my room I complained keamanan times to one member of staff and twice to another it never got resolved so I had to sit in the reception to use my tablet were they watched me do this;kebersihan;1
 No room service no bar;kebersihan;1
 No thing actually ;kebersihan;1
 No WiFi in breakfast area;kebersihan;1
 None Whatsoever;kebersihan;1
 Nothing I loved the place Only complaint which is very minor is that I did not have my shower cap replaced more frequently ;kebersihan;1
 Nothing I was excellent ;kebersihan;1
 Nothing we were very happy ;kebersihan;1
 Only one thing poor wifi connection;kebersihan;1
 Perhaps a conversion to English on Tv channels;kebersihan;1
 pretty small room and poor breakfast;kebersihan;1
 Pricing is very high particularly for early Spring ;kebersihan;1
 Proper double bed rather than kerapihan singles put together ;kebersihan;1
 Room and bathroom were tiny could barely towel myself in the bathroom without hitting my elbows Had to sit sideways on the toilet due to highly inadequate leg room ;kebersihan;1
 Room is bit small and the bath tub wasn t practical at all ;kebersihan;1
 Room really small Bath even smaller and the shower was half broken;kebersihan;1
 Room was really quite small limited with kerapihan bags as was the bed though you couldn t have got a bigger bed in there I know they are in the process of renovating some floors and maybe could add better lighting to the hallways leading up to room and bigger numbers on doors ;kebersihan;1
 Rooms are a bit dated iron was old and leaked dirt on to clothes They could have cleared tables of used plates so we didn t have to;kebersihan;1
 Rooms are on the small side although that s normal for Paris Location is a little more south than most tourist sites but transit is available ;kebersihan;1
 rooms on the small side but man its Paris and this is a lovely hotel to stay in and area to visit ;kebersihan;1
 Scrambled egg was hard not particularly inviting;kebersihan;1
 Shower and bathroom in general could be better;kebersihan;1
 Shower tiles joins had some mold that were almost completely cleaned after I mentioned it to the reception ;kebersihan;1
 Small bathroom weird door for the toilet ;kebersihan;1
 Small beds small room for keamanan people;kebersihan;1
 Small elevator;kebersihan;1
 Small rooms are very jammed There is no minibar or kettle in these rooms ;kebersihan;1
 Some difficulty in getting TV to work;kebersihan;1
 Some people will find the rooms too small for their taste We did not mind and were happy to compromise on space for the beautiful decor Breakfast is just ok so book without and eat at nearby cafes ;kebersihan;1
 Some staff were not very friendly Took a while to warm up to you There was some miss communication with the airier pick up I gave them all the flight info but because they could identify the airline code they didn t send a pick up They could have easily called the airport or type in the airline code I provided But little apology was given they seemed more intent on blaming me for not receiving their email Anyway public transport worked out to be much cheaper and easy thank you Paris metro ;kebersihan;1
 Sound insulation between the rooms is not perfect No big deal though ;kebersihan;1
 Staff weren t very welcoming and friendly;kebersihan;1
 The bed was a bit hard for us but that s simply a matter of preference ;kebersihan;1
 The breakfast has hardly changed in keamanankenyamanan years except they now add dry scrambled eggs and baked beans Not good enough in such a hotel;kebersihan;1
 The breakfast is the weakest link They have an outstanding breakfast at Hotel Des Gobelins If they could have something similar I would never stay at a different hotel in my future stays in Paris ;kebersihan;1
 The breakfast selection wasn t great and they ran out of a lot of things ;kebersihan;1
 The breakfast starts at 7 while I had to leave at 6 kebersihan5 I am not sure whether the labor laws in France allow it to start the breakfast at 6 but it would be nice ;kebersihan;1
 The breakfast was a bit limited and the staff for this service were very slow Most of the people were complaining about it;kebersihan;1
 The cleaning staff was inconsistent and did not provide us with sufficient toiletries i e toilet paper soap so we would have to go down to the front desk to request them which was a bit of a hassle ;kebersihan;1
 The continental breakfast wasn t worth it worth going out or the hotel;kebersihan;1
 The corridors could have been a little wider for luggage A better iron and ironing board wouldn t go a miss and The tap in the bathroom was hard to turn on too However apart from that everything was perfect ;kebersihan;1
 The doors automatically slam when you close them it s a little annoying because of the noise;kebersihan;1
 The doors of other rooms closing was a bit noisy Some weird edges and trip hazards in the room ;kebersihan;1
 The internet it was so bad;kebersihan;1
 The maid service is iffy We stayed for 6 days and only had our room cleaned for keamanan of those days although we left early in the morning and didn t return till mid afternoon The biggest problem is the design of the rooms especially the bathrooms It s as if the designer thought how can I make this bathroom as difficult as possible to use The sink takes up half the room leaving no room for storing toiletries but it s so badly designed that the water only trickles out because otherwise the sink would overflow The taps are round and smooth so you can t turn them off with wet hands which is kind of the point of using them You have to walk under the shower to set the temperature so you freeze or boil while doing so The rooms even for Paris are extremely small so you end up with bruises from constantly tripping over furniture Too bad because it s a wonderful location and the front desk staff are great ;kebersihan;1
 The metro was like kebersihankenyamananmin by walk and if you are planning to shop and use the metro it tAkes like keamanankenyamanan to champ elysees or Madeleine or etc and when u walk back to hotel from the train station is all up the street so makes u more tired after a long day ;kebersihan;1
 The price of the taxi to the airport totally over rated ;kebersihan;1
 The Room is a bit small for guests coming for long trips with a bigger suitcase;kebersihan;1
 The room is quite small but not out of the norm for Europe There is very little room to have suitcases open ;kebersihan;1
 The room was a little small and the breakfast area too hot at times;kebersihan;1
 The room we were upgraded to featured a double bed made of two singles which kept moving apart ;kebersihan;1
 The shower fittings were very shiny and hard to grip but I gather they are to be replaced in September The overhead shower there was a hand grip shower as well tended to flood the whole bathroom as there was no lip to keep the water inside the shower staff ;kebersihan;1
 The size of the rooms and the quality of the Internet were poor;kebersihan;1
 The tiny lift and very narrow staircase to the room and the limited space in the room I stayed in could be a problem if you have luggage ;kebersihan;1
 The TV didn t work although we did not call for help The light switches were hard to figure out I wasn t able to turn on the reading lights on the bed without turning on the rest of the room lights Not a big deal for a one night stay ;kebersihan;1
 The wifi did not always work there was no hand wash facilities in the toilet the room was a little small The couple in the next room Room number 65 were fighting in the hallway we reported them which stopped it for kerapihankenyamanan mins they then carried on for another kebersihan 5 hrs we went out to them on two occasions and told them to keep quiet as it was kebersihan keamanankenyamananam in the morning and they had woken us up ;kebersihan;1
 There is no bidet at the toillete;kebersihan;1
 There s no where to hang up towels after a shower and the room was very compact ;kebersihan;1
 There was a few places that could have used a little more detail when cleaning ;kebersihan;1
 There was no dividing door between the bedroom and the bathroom No shower ;kebersihan;1
 There was no soap in the bathroom The night manager tried to find some for us in the hotel but didn t find any The safe was very small could not fit a laptop Breakfast was so so ;kebersihan;1
 There wasn t anything that stuck out as being negative ;kebersihan;1
 Too much deodorizer or scent in the room;kebersihan;1
 Took a while to get key from night porter to busy on his phone ;kebersihan;1
 Towel racks would be nice ;kebersihan;1
 TV had only French channels No BBC CNN EuroNews English I find it unusual not having any newchannel in English where most customers were not French Please control your payment one day before check out time I checked my bill one before my checkout day In my case there was a discrepancy between their room rate and booking com rate It was later corrected I had the print out booking com t helped me If it were on the day I check out there would be problem Advise for booking com customers ;kebersihan;1
 Was twin single beds pushed together instead of double ;kebersihan;1
 We booked a deluxe garden view room with kerapihan single beds What did we get A room that felt like a cave with a double bed no shower and not even a door on the bathroom When we asked for another room they said they were fully booked and gave us a bedsheet and a roll of duct tape to create some privacy for the bathroom When we checked out we were charged the same price as the deluxe room The complimentary water had already had a few gulps from it ;kebersihan;1
 We have no complaints at all ;kebersihan;1
 We were up on the kenyamananth floor and could not cool our room down since the air conditioning was set centrally Very warm Another disappointment were the directions from CDG airport that were given from the Select website Instead of the recommended bus we would take the train Much quicker and easier with no transfers Other than those two things we absolutely loved our stay and will be back ;kebersihan;1
 While we were lucky to be given an upgrade the room was smallish but this is common place in Paris ;kebersihan;1
 Wi Fi was very poor in our room;kebersihan;1
 Wifi access was non existent in my room near the lobby and at breakfast;kebersihan;1

 Wifi signal not great or consistent The bar and lounge was just some chairs If I wanted anything from the bar someone had to be called Overpriced for what was there My room was in a far corner that was dark hard to see where the keyhole was Room very small Housekeeping left the hose for the vacuum in the hall for most of the daay ;kebersihan;1
 Would be nice to have also some vegetables for breakfast ;kebersihan;1
 keamanan5 minutes walking distance from museums We didn t mind but not for everyone;kebersihan;1
 A bad start with an arrogant unwelcoming receptionist The lift was not working with 5 floors to climb and I did not feel well The room was over heated and air conditioning not working Unfortunately you can t open the windows as the hotel is on a high traffic avenue Reception had no idea how to control the temperature nor did they make any effort to help except for shouting at us One of our worse hotel experience ever ;kebersihan;1
 A bit far away from city center but it is not a big deal if you plan to explore city by foot Approximately keamanankenyamanan minutes walking and you are on Trafalgar Square or near Tower of London ;kebersihan;1
 A little bit of a walk to Luxembourg gardens but only ten minutes;kebersihan;1
 A loud sort of humming noise on and off during the night but not sure whether it came from inside or outside so potentially not a lot that the hotel could do about that ;kebersihan;1
 A mirror in the bedroom would have been useful;kebersihan;1
 alleys are tiny old building elevator is small you have to wait sometimes for other to use it until your turn comes ;kebersihan;1
 An inconvenient and time consuming system for wifi logging ;kebersihan;1
 As it regards the breakfast the price of kebersihan7 euro I thought I had more choice to improveregarding the breakfast could have more choice to improve;kebersihan;1
 As much as I love The Zetter I do believe it is over priced for he value No breakfast included in the rates and the night rate is very high for a basic room Nice for a snazzy hide away in London but prepare to pay a large sum of money which in honesty should really buy you a lot more ;kebersihan;1
 Attention to detail We were three to a suite but the amenities were provided for two ;kebersihan;1
 Bad wi fi reception ;kebersihan;1
 bathroom needs updating but we knew that before arriving and it was not a massive problem ;kebersihan;1
 Bed was comfy but small standard double ;kebersihan;1
 Bed was quite small for a hotel Shower siding drain properly ;kebersihan;1
 Bed was tiny but then again the room was small but it s a London town centre hotel so I get it just seemed a bit pricey for the size ;kebersihan;1
 Bed was too firm needs a top mattress Car and restaurant noise coming up from the street is loud even with shutters closed I loved the place but didn t get to sleep so well Would recommend asking for a top floor room ;kebersihan;1
 Best the very best staff ever;kebersihan;1
 Bigger mug for a cup of tea but I am splitting hairs;kebersihan;1
 Blocked sink previous occupant s dinner tray left on the balcony ;kebersihan;1
 breakfast choice limited compared to price but quality good The kid gift stated in their website for family room was not given to our son but not that important Raspail metro station which is closest to the hotel was closed and hotel needed to tell in advance and in the booking or hotel websites to plan to get off in Vavin station or Edgar Quinet which are also very close ;kebersihan;1
 Breakfast needs improving as does the staff;kebersihan;1
 Breakfast seemed expensive so we didn t eat there Traffic a little noisy in morning ;kebersihan;1
 Breakfast seemed rather expensive kerapihankenyamanan for full English cup of tea though was good;kebersihan;1
 Breakfast was expensive at kebersihan8 so gave it a skip and had a nice breakfast out for kebersihankenyamanan ;kebersihan;1
 Breakfast was included last time I stayed buy now it s additional;kebersihan;1
 Breakfast was limited for the cost I would not take this inclusion in the future ;kebersihan;1
 Cannot respond I have no complaints;kebersihan;1
 Design in public areas seems a bit old ;kebersihan;1
 Didn t find any problems;kebersihan;1
 Didn t like the handheld shower The bathroom tile was moldy and or dirty Bathtub was dirt stained Pictures on the web were nothing like the decor of our room ;kebersihan;1
 Double bed was a little small but that s being super picky ;kebersihan;1
 Double bed way too small for Superior room Restaurant and bar area was far better before revamp Fruit salad little stale Disappointed compared with our last stay keamanan kenyamanan years ago Had much more pizazz then ;kebersihan;1
 Double beds in our standard guest rooms were a little bit narrow;kebersihan;1
 everything satisfied;kebersihan;1
 Food is somewhat pricey;kebersihan;1
 For a four star hotel and the price rooms were small Breakfast for what they offer is far too expensive;kebersihan;1
 For the price of the room coffee making facilities in the room should be the norm especially as breakfast was not included Also an advance payment of kerapihan5 on my credit card was requested for extras as soon as we signed in We did not have any extras so I m hoping that as promised the money will be credited to us ;kebersihan;1
 Free wi fi worked well but had to log on daily ;kebersihan;1
 Great location with plenty of restaurant choices and several supermarkets very close There are also large department stores less than a mile away Friendly and helpful staff Train station is walkable and metro is very close to this hotel ;kebersihan;1
 Hair dryer didn t work Neither it worked in the other room of our companions Shower water got cold during my shower ;kebersihan;1
 hearing some noise from the street;kebersihan;1
 I could smell cigarette smoke by the door of my hotel room due to its proximity to the breakfast room ;kebersihan;1
 I didn t like the air quality in Paris as much as I do where I live esp the man smoking on the balcony next to ours I didn t like crowded metros That s about it ;kebersihan;1
 I didnt like the fixed shower ;kebersihan;1
 I don t like rain showers as I had to keep my hair dry we were there to go to a special event and I d had my hair done and so I couldn t use the shower easily Would have preferred a detachable shower head ;kebersihan;1
 I think that for the price the breakfast should have been included As I recall the breakfast cost kebersihan7 Euros ;kebersihan;1
 I would have been happier if the WiFi access was unlimited ;kebersihan;1
 I would have given a much higher rating but unfortunately upon arrival I found out the elevator was not working and had not been working for more than kerapihan months It should have been noted on the site as the works have been going for over kerapihan months and it should have been reflected in a discount on the room price ;kebersihan;1
 Ironing board was average as not flat in the middle making it hard to iron ;kebersihan;1
 It was all excellent;kebersihan;1
 Just wish was one more mirror besides the one in the bathroom Saves time when two people are trying to get dressed in a hurry HINT There was room on the wall for one quite easily ;kebersihan;1
 Lift being refurbished;kebersihan;1
 Lift broke down twice ;kebersihan;1
 Like all french hotels very small lift elevator ;kebersihan;1
 Loved everything about the property ;kebersihan;1
 More milk cream could be supplied in room but no problem having further supplies delivered;kebersihan;1
 more variety for the breakfast noises form other rooms TV was not working ;kebersihan;1
 My major complaint was no washcloths I know not much to complain about Breakfast for adults was a bit pricey but really not much more than anywhere else in Paris And it was quite a nice spread Choice of full buffet or just a continental breakfast ;kebersihan;1
 Nice room but very small Tiny in fact Very small pokey elevator I used the stairs but luckily I was only on the second floor Did not take breakfast option as highly overpriced at kebersihan7 ;kebersihan;1
 No complaints Perfect for our purpose ;kebersihan;1
 No French or European TV channels;kebersihan;1
 No gym or fitness of any kind ;kebersihan;1
 No handheld shower Room felt cramped Snacks were crammed onto the corner of already tiny desk Apart from ground floor decor felt dated and aggressive especially the neon multi coloured lighting Hot water bottle on bed is a nice idea in theory but how many people s sweaty feet has it been on ;kebersihan;1
 No hot drinks facilities in the room unforgivable for this standard of hotel;kebersihan;1
 No parking on site but this is London so this has to be taken into account ;kebersihan;1
 No walk in showers;kebersihan;1
 Not applicable we liked everything about the hotel ;kebersihan;1
 Not enough power sockets in the room could have done with an extension lead Logging into Wifi every kerapihankenyamanan hours was a pain Breakfast was average but plenty of choice locally No shower curtain needed to hold shower head which lead to a very wet bathroom but I guess this Parisienne thing ;kebersihan;1
 Not handing key in;kebersihan;1
 Not just for this particular hotel but all the others we stayed in no one has washcloths ;kebersihan;1
 Not much The Better has been good to me ;kebersihan;1
 Nothing could have been better Staff extremely helpful and courteous ;kebersihan;1
 Nothing much If I m being really picky it would have been nice if some of the snacks in the room on the loyalty tray had been appropriate for breakfast time ie a biscuit or flapjack rather than just salty or chocolate based As I say a very small thing as we really liked everything else ;kebersihan;1
 Nothing much really NCP parking is a couple of streets away and not particularly easy to find due to one way roads ;kebersihan;1
 Nothing not tool like our stay was too short;kebersihan;1
 Nothing really other than perhaps the cost could have been a little less ;kebersihan;1
 Nothing really the coffee at breakfast was a bit strong but that s personal taste I think nothing wrong with the quality ;kebersihan;1
 Nothing thought it was excellent reception fantastic polite efficient quick check and out would definitely recommend;kebersihan;1
 Nothing we were treated very well ;kebersihan;1
 One very minor gripe was that they charged us an extra for a chocolate bar that showed up as taken from the food items left in the room We didn t take anything from the food tray and I sent an email to the hotel after to note this I also told them it was fine that we did not want a refund of the kebersihan 6kenyamanan That s how much we enjoyed our stay and appreciated their hospitality I was just surprised not to receive an email back But it s minor ;kebersihan;1
 Our room was a bit low on drawer shelf space ;kebersihan;1
 Pillows too big to my taste mattress quite hard ;kebersihan;1
 Pillows with feathers would be nice;kebersihan;1
 Pity breakfast was an additional expense Hot water hot milk and a tea bag does not make a good pot of English tea Although complementary tea coffee were provided housekeeping had left provision for kerapihan instead of keamanan persons We did get the extra cup etc when we contacted reception ;kebersihan;1
 restaurant and bar a bit old hat more hip atmosphere with small plates food would be good Loved being able to walk to Workshop Coffee or Modern Pantry for breakfast but would have liked same vibe in hotel eating area ;kebersihan;1
 Restaurant cold and expensive so went to Greasy spoon app for brekkie which was great Top notch restaurant behind the hotel and great bar burger place opposite ;kebersihan;1
 Restaurant was a bit dead but plenty of options in the area ;kebersihan;1
 Room 5kebersihan needs a better shower;kebersihan;1
 Room and bed very small Maybe it s a London thing ;kebersihan;1
 room is very comfortable and smallish no problem for a single traveler ;kebersihan;1
 Room slightly noisy We could hear neighbours ;kebersihan;1
 Room was cold and a bit small Slow check in Hot chocolate was too sweet and not milky enough ;kebersihan;1
 Room was much smaller than it looked on the pictures bit too cosy for two people travelling on elsewhere for kebersihankenyamanan days with luggage ;kebersihan;1
 room was too noisy could hear other guests room was too hot no air conditioning working;kebersihan;1
 Room was very small for the money Bed was squeaky Service charged on drinks that I ordered from the bar ;kebersihan;1
 Rooms were small which is typical for city centre but modern and very clean ;kebersihan;1
 Rooms were tiny so no room for a fridge or coffee making facilities ;kebersihan;1
 Safe failed to open Took several visits from the staff to get it open Howeevr staff were very pleasant ;kebersihan;1
 Service was appalling I love france french culture french products history But there is the bad side too this hotel represents that Go elsewhere ;kebersihan;1
 shortage of coffee supplies in my room ;kebersihan;1
 Shower leaked on the floor of the shower;kebersihan;1
 Small room Staff was eager to help but didn t have much info on local restaurants ;kebersihan;1
 small rooms terrible bed stone matrass kebersihan 8kenyamanan long bed way too small;kebersihan;1
 Small snafu with AC unit in room but staff tried to help with it ;kebersihan;1
 so hot;kebersihan;1
 Sofa bed as only option for children could have been more comfortable Would be great if they could fit two small singles or pull out beds in same space ;kebersihan;1
 softer pillows would have been nice and maybe a coffee machine in the lobby ;kebersihan;1
 Some staff spoke very poor English;kebersihan;1
 Someone on our floor was smoking so we were woken up several times with a smoke filled room This was obviously not the hotel s fault but they were unable to prevent it the next night too ;kebersihan;1
 Staff attitude on arrival was poor but on checking out was great Very dark small room just not worth the cost Noisy person in room above stomped about all night making a good night s sleep impossible ;kebersihan;1
 That I had to leave so soon ;kebersihan;1
 The armchairs did not really fit in with the decor the coffee machine in the corridor was a total waste Coffee making facilities need to be in the room The reception area was very much budget hotel style ;kebersihan;1
 The bathroom door was difficult to open close;kebersihan;1
 The bathroom had large clear window with no curtain had concerns regarding privacy At night main door was closed until opened by Reception Sometime needed to wait several minutes as it was unmanned ;kebersihan;1
 The bathroom is so small;kebersihan;1
 The bed was too soft and the heating was very noisy even when set on lowest option it ran all night Breakfast staff were friendly but not very efficient delivering some items twice and missing other things off the order ;kebersihan;1
 The bed was very creaky and old and not that comfortable ;kebersihan;1
 The bed was very soft too soft and not supportive enough this impacted on our quality of sleep ;kebersihan;1
 the bedroom was small but adequate;kebersihan;1
 The beds could have been a little better but pretty good still;kebersihan;1
 The breakfast room did not look appealing so we ate elsewhere as there are many cafes nearby ;kebersihan;1
 The breakfast was excellent but providing a smaller breakfast would be an alternative As an older couple we participated in the breakfast only once during our stay of 7 days because for us it was too big of a meal to start the day ;kebersihan;1
 The carpet in the left is not well cleaned But all other areas are very clean;kebersihan;1
 The dim and coloured lighting does hide some rough joinery work They preauthorised kerapihan5 from my card at checkin presumably in case I was tempted to steal from the minibar which was insulting We arrived on a cold day to a cold room We were heading out for the evening so we left a card in the slot and the heating on maximum We returned just after kebersihankenyamanan to a cold room and obviously non functioning heating By kebersihankebersihanpm the maintenance guy had got it working and delivered a heater This wasn t how we wanted to spend our time though Obviously the room wasn t checked properly beforehand We were offered complimentary breakfast in compensation which was fair although nobody communicated this to the front desk who tried to charge for it on check out The full English breakfast for kebersihankerapihan is fine but is more an assembly of ingredients than a well prepared meal There is an atrium above a bar lounge and the rooms are arranged in a circles around the atrium This means that you hear people laughing and shouting in the bar when your room door is shut although this is only annoying when you eventually get to bed and can hear it quite plainly The bathroom is ok but the shower controls are hard to get right The free newspaper is the evening standard which is a free paper anyhow The trend for hotels to withdraw services to save make money e g communal coffee making facilities no porter bellboy makes for disappointment because the lack of staff shows I don t think the Zetter was good value at kerapihankenyamanankenyamanan a night ;kebersihan;1
 The doors are wafer thin you hear everything including it sounds like people in the hall are in your room The bathroom was oblong shaped and did not have a shower it was awkward and not relaxing to try and bath Last the towels were old and thin nothing that you would expect from a kenyamanan star hotel let alone kerapihan star They were really worn out and should have been replaced a long time ago Would stay here for the right price if I liked to take baths and if I planned on travelling with my own towels otherwise would not stay here again Last they have a policy that when you leave you must leave your key at the front desk We are not used to such a policy at any other hotel and it was a bit unsettling to do so Though nothing appears to have gone missing ;kebersihan;1
 The elevator is tiny true of all inner city Paris hotels though ;kebersihan;1
 The elevator was broken The A C was broken The WIFI kept on turning off;kebersihan;1
 The fact I had to check out Ha ;kebersihan;1
 The food was expensive ;kebersihan;1
 The free wi fi was for only an hour;kebersihan;1
 The hotel advertised that it was very close to the train station Gare Montparnasse as if it was just across the street and it was more like a kebersihankenyamanan kebersihan5 minute walk from the hotel No big deal but I thought we were going to just have to take our luggage across the street to the train station ;kebersihan;1
 The hotel was generally very old It really needed renovation Bidet in our room was broken and it just had an out of order sign on it instead of being repaired I don t recommend the rooms on top floor The windows are above head level So the room had a cell feeling ;kebersihan;1
 The housekeeping at the hotel was quite bad When we asked the reception to make sure the beds were made properly they simply left us a new set of sheets on the bed and dirty laundry on the floor Very disappointing ;kebersihan;1
 The immediate vicinity is quiet at weekends although there are some hidden gems of cafes and restaurants very near;kebersihan;1
 The kitchen and cleaning staff sometimes did not speak English ;kebersihan;1
 The location is a tricky one if you don t know London or are familiar with the tube The nearest tube is Farringdon Road but getting onto connecting services such as the Hammersmith city or circle lines can be awkward when carrying luggage Coffee tea making facilities are on the landing and did create an awkward moment in dressing gowns ;kebersihan;1
 The lunch menu was a tiny bit overpriced but the quality was excellent ;kebersihan;1
 The mattresses were obviously good quality but we found them firmer than we prefer ;kebersihan;1
 The noise of the people next door;kebersihan;1
 The only thing was that the hotel is small so the corridors and rooms are not very spacious ;kebersihan;1
 The personal at the reception was really confused talking to himself and seemed to bit unorganized The rooms are very small for a four star hotel for more than kebersihan kerapihan nights the rooms are too small to stay The elevator was under construction during the days of staying there so carrying luggage from the very top to the very down floor and upstairs in pretty narrow steps might be tricky if you re have heavy bags ;kebersihan;1
 The rates per night are okay for Parisian standards but not cheap We didn t have the breakfast for kebersihan8 EUR which was quite pricy in our opinion There are so many places to have a good and affordable breakfast in the Montparnasse district ;kebersihan;1
 The room size Quite a hard bed but nice bed linen No drinking water in the room ;kebersihan;1
 The room was quite small and the road noise was a little bothersome as the room was very warm when we arrived and we had to open a window I also didn t like so many snacks being placed in the rooms;kebersihan;1
 The room was really hot the aircon turned off every 5 minutes and had a set minimum of kebersihan9 degrees which it definitely wasn t reaching We spoke to the staff but they weren t able to get it to stay on Luckily it wasn t too hot outside so we could open the window ;kebersihan;1
 The room was really too smal The parking outside the hotel The breakfast;kebersihan;1
 The rooms are quite small but that s standard in London;kebersihan;1
 The service charge put on everything The night porter very nice person but needs to be trained more about serving drinks at the bar ;kebersihan;1
 The shower was difficult to get working Won der weggaat restaurant would be without the popup LeBun Less eclectic than Zetter Townhouse ;kebersihan;1
 The shower was very trying as difficult to get the temperature right ;kebersihan;1
 The staff let the Zetter down Their first contact with you is not great my girlfriend arrived after me and the staff were quite unhelpful in getting her to the room The service in the restaurant was slow ;kebersihan;1
 The staff were uninterested the hotel was very unaccommodating when we requested a refund 6 weeks before our stay for the last night as we had to leave earlier Booking com approved the refund but the hotel blamed their decision on Booking com ;kebersihan;1
 The traffic noise is not louder than any other part of downtown but we are a little perspective because we live in a pedestrian area back home ;kebersihan;1
 The TV was complicated ;kebersihan;1
 There could have been more electrical outlets near the desk;kebersihan;1
 There was a fault with the lock on my door which meant I couldn t lock it reception explained that the locks had just been upgraded so perhaps this one was just an anomaly The biggest disappointment was the shower which didn t drain properly and flooded part of the bathroom floor Also the Bose speaker had an unpredictable connection mechanism I mentioned all these points in my feedback when I checked out and the staff did apologise ;kebersihan;1
 They cordon off the bar area during the day for something called Club Zetter rendering hotel guests second class citizens who are not allowed in the area Wifi is annoying The speed is good but requires constantly re entering password etc ;kebersihan;1
 Too much noise from traffic outside;kebersihan;1
 Training of night porter staff when serving at the bar ;kebersihan;1
 Tv screen a bit small;kebersihan;1
 Very bad Wi Fi ;kebersihan;1
 Very rude one of the receptionists ;kebersihan;1
 We chose to get breakfast at local bakeries instead of paying for the hotel buffet The elevator was very small requiring a couple of trips to get to the upper floors ;kebersihan;1
 We did not take breakfast as it was EURkebersihan8 per person including each child That would have been EUR 7kerapihan for a family of kenyamanan which I found a little bit too expensive for breakfast I would have wished for a cheaper kids price in many hotels kids eat breakfast for free or definately at a discounted price ;kebersihan;1
 We had a room on the kenyamananth floor and it was okay but with the bar downstairs and an open landing area I suspect it would of been a bit noisy on the kebersihanst or kerapihannd floors;kebersihan;1
 We had to upgrade to have enough space for a travel cot Even so the room wasn t spacious although the bathroom was huge that s where we parked the buggy ;kebersihan;1
 We liked to all but did not take breakfast there because we felt it was steep at kebersihan8 However after our comment concerning the high cost of their breakfast they responded most positively and now offer a continental breakfast for 9 So nothing to not like ;kebersihan;1
 We paid a lot for our one bedroom suite and were still charged extra for parking and breakfast didn t feel overly reasonable even for Paris Would have been nice for a four star property to have a gym available ;kebersihan;1
 We ve requested one queen size bed when making reservations but there was two single beds just brought together ;kebersihan;1
 We would have liked some TV channels other than the news in English ;kebersihan;1
 Well they don t have a fitness facility but I knew that going in ;kebersihan;1
 went in the cocktail lounge at night thought it was a poor selection of food;kebersihan;1
 While there will always be a continuous need for staff training it felt like work in progress and as though when we approached the Reception Desk we didn t really want to interrupt the induction of new staff Breakfast was good but the service was a bit slow despite it being quiet when we ate and not very informative We chose the Full English which was kebersihankerapihan all in including toast and coffee but our bill for kerapihan people was keamanankenyamanan not sure why and were in a hurry when checking out and so didn t query it ;kebersihan;1
 Wi fi was inconsistent ;kebersihan;1
 Wish breakfast was included in the price of room;kebersihan;1
 Wish our room had a bath and that the extra towel requested upon checkin was replaced each night ;kebersihan;1
 Would be nice to have a fridge in the room ;kebersihan;1
 Would have rated higher if There had been a bath;kebersihan;1
 A bit bigger room It was small ;kebersihan;1
 A bit far from the nearest metro station the washing room facility seems a bit dated and dirty;kebersihan;1
 A bit noisy when your room is on the street The windows do not filter enough ;kebersihan;1
 A bit remote from the City and the traffic is rather congested and slow kerapihankenyamananmph in certain parts of the road It is a good spot for visitors who intend to stay in the East side of London but not for those who need to travel to the City frequently ;kebersihan;1
 A couple of minor things toilet flush a bit loose and sockets for chargers not working but very minor quibbles;kebersihan;1
 A little bit dark and restaurant not open at lunch on the Sunday;kebersihan;1
 A little bit quiet in the bar;kebersihan;1
 A small detail the temperature of the air conditioning on the lobby was too cold;kebersihan;1
 AC in one of the rooms not working very well but was just cool enough AC in the other room worked very well ;kebersihan;1
 Air conditioning could have been cooler Mentioned it a couple of times to reception but considering the amount of time we spent in the room it wasn t a big issue;kebersihan;1
 All in general;kebersihan;1
 As another visitor said it was a little difficult to find when on foot but maybe that s a style thing that goes with this cute funky little hotel ;kebersihan;1
 Atmosphere was a bit dark;kebersihan;1
 average breakfast;kebersihan;1
 Based on a kenyamananstars hotel No presentation of the room by the personal Bathroom not perfectly cleaned limestone on the sink No roomservice menu ;kebersihan;1
 Bathroom has no door Windows facing windows of other room There is no restaurant or any food service at the hotel You can only order food from Japanese restaurant Water smells and tastes like water with chlorine from the pool ;kebersihan;1
 Bathroom offered little privacy Beautiful facility but with open area of shower tub and no curtain it made sharing the lavatory while someone was bathing impossible There was a separate WC area that helped a great deal We quickly adapted and made it work out well Upon checkout the desk staff had copy of my credit card and told me that when the last of our group of keamanan left she could handle the check out kerapihan of us were leaving early however I was later told by the last member of our group that she had to put the charge on her card That could have been a major disaster had the last member of group not been able to handle the fee on her card ;kebersihan;1
 bathroom specially toilet flush;kebersihan;1
 Bed could be better it was not comfortable for me ;kebersihan;1
 Being in Paris when terrorists attack Everything closed which left little to do but walk the sites ;kebersihan;1

 Breakfast was a bit monotonous more variety would ve been nice ;kebersihan;1
 Caution the room sizes differ in the same category Standard Double room with balcony is bigger than a standard double room with windows The hotel staff however did not agree The floor looked extremly crammed Also the carpet did smell of dust The hotel recpeption was a little confused about everything which maybe due to lack of manpower ;kebersihan;1
 Check in was poor Was given no information about were rooms were what time breakfast was between were breakfast was held or any basic information about hotel ;kebersihan;1
 Clean and modern hotel Helpful staff Good location ;kebersihan;1
 Cleaning stuff knocking on my door on Sunday at 9 am ;kebersihan;1
 Closeness to heart of Paris Loads of restaurants and bars nearby;kebersihan;1
 Continental breakfast rather meagre choice from a 5 star hotel;kebersihan;1
 Could be a bit more refined for a Four Seasons ;kebersihan;1
 Could find the entrance when we arrived ;kebersihan;1
 Could not control room temperature no real room service if you wish to stay in for dinner rather than going out;kebersihan;1
 Could not controll temp wi FI slow ;kebersihan;1
 Couldn t fault the hotel or the staff;kebersihan;1
 Det var lite d ligt utbud p bra restauranger i n rheten men det var samtidigt n ra till huvudgatorna och d r fanns det mer att ta Det fanns gg och bacon p frukosten som verkade ha legat d r ett tag F rslagsvis kan man ju steka p lite i taget eftersom det inte verkade g t ;kebersihan;1
 Didn t get no sleep Fighting and banging crying women shouting for help Was a right funny old night ;kebersihan;1
 Everything was fine A very great place to stay ;kebersihan;1
 Heat of common areas ;kebersihan;1
 Hot breakfast wasn t an option though what was served was excellent;kebersihan;1
 Housecleaning on the second day could have been better On the other days it was OK ;kebersihan;1
 I always miss fitness sauna whenever not available ;kebersihan;1
 I believe that during our stay the hotel was fully booked At breakfast the staff could not follow in replenishing the buffet I also believe that the bathroom could use a little more details of design ;kebersihan;1
 I can honestly not think of anything that could be improved This is an absolute jewel of a hotel and we enjoyed every minute;kebersihan;1
 I didn t appreciate how they trick us into getting the attic of the hotel I booked a suite and they give me the worst one I should have been more selective and never approve on getting that room We have to bend because letterly we were at the attic And when it was raining we hear the rain like we were sleeping in a tin can The bed was so in comfortable And the breakfast buffet need to be better The coffee for example is tasteless The front desk were very helpful during our stay But when I ask about the sports channel I expect an answer other than I m alone at the desk I can t help you with anything ;kebersihan;1
 I entered the bar for a drink the person on duty did not acknowledge me I think you have to go to reception from the bar to order a drink but he could see me in the bar still didn t acknowledge me Not a big problem but I think service could be improved if guests are properly acknowledged;kebersihan;1
 I paid in full for my 7 nights stay at the hotel before I checked in and yet on the day when I checked out the reception staff asked for an extra kebersihan6 for tourist tax This should have been included into the rates or stated on booking com very disappointing ;kebersihan;1
 I was not given the room I had purchased The hotel said as the obvious excuse that they were fully booked and that it was the last available surly booking com would have advised before the purchase ;kebersihan;1
 If I m honest I felt it was too expensive for the food drink ;kebersihan;1
 if you want to work in the room the confort could be improved;kebersihan;1
 in a superior room could have been a complimentary bottle of water ;kebersihan;1
 In room dining Very well organised but the food is poor No terraces in the hotel You feel stocked No upgrades or presents with a ten nights stay ;kebersihan;1
 In room hospitality charges were ridiculous 9 for a miniature JD keamanan 5kenyamanan for water Also on the Saturday night boy racers seem to meet up in the road tunnels and rev their engines Was a bit like living at Silverstone Not hotels fault obviously and at least they seemed to get bored after an hour ;kebersihan;1
 In the double rooms the bathroom is not really separated with walls from the room Sort of a glass door which is not closing perfectly The sink is in the room and shower and the toilet are separted We have asked if a late check out would be possible considering we have checked out on Sunday when not too many tourists are checking in and they said is possible for keamanan hours keamanankenyamanan euro 5 hours 5kenyamanan euro ;kebersihan;1
 It was just right ;kebersihan;1
 It was very expensive we knew that when we booked but I expected a bit more Housekeeping did not remove empty glasses cold coffee cups from our room There was no tea making facilities in the room just a Nespresso machine I had to ask for our toiletries to be replenished as they left one small bottle of each for two people for kerapihan days The staff seemed bored and the hotel appeared empty It was soulless Not a place for families far more geared up for the business clientele Next time we go to London we will stay in the centre and try and find a hotel with some character ;kebersihan;1
 Just breakfast repetitive Because we stayed for ten days ;kebersihan;1
 Lights;kebersihan;1
 Limited catering facilities but what there was proved of good quality ;kebersihan;1
 Mattress was Tooooooo soft in room 5kenyamanankerapihan;kebersihan;1
 Maybe a bit overpriced ;kebersihan;1
 Maybe the breakfast doesn t have a great variety over the week but this is a detail really A pool would maybe be nice but since there is so much to do the great bath and shower already helped to relax after a long day of visiting and walking ;kebersihan;1
 Mixup with payment that came in as an inconvenience that the staff was most helpful with Wharf side of the hotel is not livable to me it s overlooking ugly concrete constructions and supernoisy kerapihankenyamanan 7;kebersihan;1
 Mosty everything ;kebersihan;1

 No hairdryer in the room;kebersihan;1
 No hot water in the tap so I used shower to wash my face in the morning ;kebersihan;1
 No openable window in the room;kebersihan;1

 Nothing really not to like To be picky the parking could ve been better but I wouldn t expect much better in the city ;kebersihan;1
 Nothing really to complain about Expect maybe could have more egg options at breakfast but anyway was perfect ;kebersihan;1
 Nothing relevant maybe more choices of eggs at breakfast and the fact that the cleaning services were not always the same Usually the room was spotless but on one day we found our garbage bag on the floor near the door ;kebersihan;1
 Nothing we were very pleased with our stay This was our second visit and will book again in kerapihankenyamanankebersihan7;kebersihan;1
 Only slight problem in a converted town house is that the breakfast room is small and a little cramped when busy Chairs a bit too large for the space and buffet is hard to access if other guests already there ;kebersihan;1
 Our bed wasn t double bed as requested We had two single beds joined together ;kebersihan;1
 Our bedroom smelt of stale smoke ;kebersihan;1
 Our only complaint was that there was no replacement for the drinking water which was probably due to a communications breakdown on our side when we mentioned it to the housekeeping staff ;kebersihan;1
 Our room was not ready on our arrival due to a late check out we were offered an alternative but I specifically asked for a front facing balcony when I booked the room so we waited in the bar with a complementary drink whilst the room was cleaned Only two milks on the tea coffee tray No table and chairs on balcony ;kebersihan;1
 Our room was on the kebersihanst floor a bit noisy late at night from patrons at a restaurant across the road and music from the same premises ;kebersihan;1

 Pillows were a bit too high;kebersihan;1
 Plug in bath faulty so could not take a bath Towels a bit grey Electric lights came on after stepped out of room or lift Nobody closed the curtains at night Only kebersihan staff at reception at any time I had to wait for check in Not their fault but husband banging on his wife s bedroom door and shouting loudly and aggressively woke me up I felt if there was cctv this could have been addressed without me having to call reception ;kebersihan;1
 Poor breakfast Eggs for extra money ;kebersihan;1
 Poor signage to the Virgin Health club which is just behind the Hotel but its hard to find the entrance;kebersihan;1
 Price especially for breakfast;kebersihan;1
 Price of food and drinks were very over priced breakfast not included in our stay even though you are paying keamanankenyamanankenyamanan a night which was quite disappointing;kebersihan;1
 Really minor but few parts of the hotel need a bit of refurbishment;kebersihan;1

 Room a bit small but well equpped and comfortable Fire alarm going off in the morning ;kebersihan;1

 Staff breakfast stained sofas in the breakfast room just arrived no one helps with the luggage we booked a deluxe king room and were given a room of a lower category on the kerapihannd floor ;kebersihan;1
 Staff was at times a bit awkward but overall a nice experience ;kebersihan;1
 Stayed in this hotel for my birthday and my friend requested a birthday cake for me as a surprise The hotel noted the request but did not do anything in relation to this Was also told at Reception while checking in that they ve got a surprise for me for my birthday yet they haven t done anything a bit disappointing but overall a good stay ;kebersihan;1
 Street is a little too busy but street noise cannot be heard inside the room;kebersihan;1
 Tea and coffee not in room upon arrival but was arranged once requested ;kebersihan;1
 That it did not have a pool and found the bar a little boring;kebersihan;1
 that your very loud vacuum cleaner was used in the lobby which is next to the breakfast area right at the time when guests were trying to enjoy their morning meal ;kebersihan;1
 The kebersihanst room we have which they happily change when we asked for a bigger one was very small Even though the breakfast is very nice they can change some of the hot and or cold items every day ;kebersihan;1
 The AC in the corridor ;kebersihan;1
 The air conditioning could have been a little better The room was too warm at times Also our room could have been more spacious as we had friends who paid the same as us but had a bigger room Also our room did not have a kettle which would have been nice ;kebersihan;1
 the aircondition was too cold in the dining room ;kebersihan;1
 The attitude of the receptionist;kebersihan;1
 The bar lounge was poorly staffed after breakfast and there were not a lot of drink options;kebersihan;1
 The bath handle showed rust or dirt underneath them the bathroom floor had dirty Staines like it hadn t been washed for awhile we was told at the check in that the breakfast charge was kebersihankenyamanan a head but we were charged kerapihankeamanan ;kebersihan;1
 The bathroom door did not close properly and the shower curtain is a poor choice for this kind of hotel;kebersihan;1
 the bathroom door made of opaque glass had a problem it didn t stay closed There wasn t any locking system and keamanan kenyamanan seconds after closing it the door was starting to slowly open we had to use a towel to keep it close wile using the bathroom Also the shower sewage was noisy we could hear the water flowing every time the shower was used in the neighbor s room ;kebersihan;1
 The bathroom was a bit old and in need of refurbishing Strange shower no matter how you try to use it you ll always end up getting the whole floor wet ;kebersihan;1
 The big down side was the breakfast and there was no hot breakfast included And what was offered as extra was poor;kebersihan;1
 The booking was canceled one day before the check in because it failed to charge the credit card although I have booked a room with a PAY AT THE PROPERTY no prepayment needed option ;kebersihan;1
 The breakfast area was rather small and cramped The water in the shower was only lukewarm at 7 pm when one wanted to shower before going out in the evening The Internet connection was very slow ;kebersihan;1
 The breakfast buffet is good value for money and has all the usual features But both the buffet and the breakfast area lack the inspired wow of the guest rooms The bar on ground floor near the breakfast area was empty during my entire stay It s evidently not working maybe it should be re thought There are no outside areas no roof terrace or similar ;kebersihan;1
 The breakfast could have a little bet more;kebersihan;1
 The breakfast included is very limited in option and need improvement;kebersihan;1
 The breakfast is very simple but for the price they charge is ok ;kebersihan;1
 The breakfast situation is not the best Even if you paid ahead they seem to want to charge you again ;kebersihan;1
 The breakfast was not so great as i like hot coffee and hot breakfasts ;kebersihan;1
 The breakfast was the same every day We stayed there for keamanan nights ;kebersihan;1
 The breakfast was the same thing everyday ;kebersihan;1
 The coffee Although cappuccino was better It would be very nice to have a little coffee machine in the room to make a decent cup of coffee ;kebersihan;1
 The concierge did not book the taxi we asked for so we missed the start of our show on the West end The staff at breakfast were hopeless so we ate breakfast out of the hotel on our second morning ;kebersihan;1
 The dark colour use between rooms and in restaurant;kebersihan;1
 The decor was too ultra modern for me The lobby did not have a welcoming feel ;kebersihan;1
 The difficulties I had to pay at the check in I paid with a V Pay card then I was told the payment did not work and had to pay with another card and then when I checked out I was asked to pay again I don t know why and had to re explain the whole mess again ;kebersihan;1
 the facility is clearly getting old and it is older than what it looks in the photos ;kebersihan;1
 the free wifi was inefficient you had to go online to log into it each time there was a faint smell of cigarettes in our bathroom;kebersihan;1
 The guests in the room above banging around until kerapihan in the morning ;kebersihan;1
 The hotel didn t have an outstanding sense of cleanness Specially shower and hallways that although dark you could see them dirty And second but just as a suggestion they offered me a Terrace room for kebersihan5 extra the night I had kerapihan rooms booked so only upgraded one To my disappointment it was the same amount of square meters than a regular room but divided between room and terrace So don t take it go to a regular double room Space wise was much more comfortable The bathroom in this terrace room was very small It could not have kerapihan people at the same time standing there the double room had a decent size bathroom ;kebersihan;1
 The hotel is really tricky to find and there is no point typing the postcode in a sat nav as it doesn t work Best advice would be to ring the hotel and ask them to direct you they clearly get asked this question a lot so are quite good at it The other thing I found unusual is without advising me they took 65 off my card just in case we used any extras we didn t so then had to wait 5 days for the money to go back on my card Not the end of the world just an annoyance ;kebersihan;1
 The hotel was soulless even though it was expensive and looked great it lacked character The key cards weren t working and we were locked out at midnight albeit they eventually sent someone up ;kebersihan;1
 The Hotel was very quiet it had changed hands in between us booking and we were not told there was nothing going on in the Hotel to keep us there drinking so we had to keep going out we were the only ones who used the courtyard because knowbody new about it if tat;kebersihan;1
 The In Room Breakfast menu was very confusing as we only wanted a light breakfast asking for just eggs with toast and coffee and ended up with two full English breakfasts When we explained one English Breakfast was removed from the bill Very enjoyable breakfast in the end ;kebersihan;1
 The internet was bad always disconnected and it was overpriced ;kebersihan;1
 The loud isolation of windows could be better the first room which was given to us was a disaster and like cave with a view to a apartment space Many people smoked at non smoked rooms therefore it smelt so bad especially in the mornings ;kebersihan;1
 The music on the hall was a bit loud and you could hear it from the room The bathroom looked a bit like it was constructed in a hurry and there were some small details to be finished ;kebersihan;1
 the odor of chemicals after the cleaning;kebersihan;1
 The only gripe is we have to ask for the beverage tray on each check in as it isn t in the room as standard However it always arrives promptly ;kebersihan;1
 The only small change the shower s water stream wasn t great An overhead rainshower or multi way hand held overhead shower would be better;kebersihan;1
 The only small criticism would be the size of the breakfast area if all guests descended on this area at the same time then it would not cope But unlikely and a small trade off for its location and style ;kebersihan;1
 the only thing I could comment on was the price of parking which we felt was a lot to ask on top of the cost of the stay ;kebersihan;1
 The price c kerapihan5kenyamanan per night was steep but Barca v busy and v weak ;kebersihan;1
 The price of room and breakfast ;kebersihan;1
 The prices of the drinks etc in the mini bar and the hotel bar are excessive but so is everything in Paris ;kebersihan;1
 The room is tight;kebersihan;1
 The room was the usual good bright and cool concept that is RoomMate Ours was very compact and because of its position in the hotel had almost no natural light we had to keep curtains closed at all times as it was overlooked There are other rooms on the front of the hotel;kebersihan;1
 The room was too small My front door was almost touching the bed The view was into the small box courtyard with the window opposite my room distance of several meters I couldn t open my curtains;kebersihan;1
 The room was very small and the window looked at the window of the room kebersihankenyamanan ft away so we could never have the curtains open Yes we could have paid for an upgrade but we had spent quite enough already on the trip and were just at this hotel keamanan nights with not much time in the room I couldn t justify the expense and for the amount suggested for the upgrade I could have booked a better room to start with rather than going over budget on site It would be fine for one person but kerapihan luggage sets created a very tight space ;kebersihan;1
 The room was very small considering the price A couple of the staff at the reception were quite rude indifferent I asked for an iron in my room before arriving that did not happen They tried to charge me for things from the mini bar when I did not use it ;kebersihan;1
 The rooms and hallways are a bit too tight and narrow ;kebersihan;1
 The rooms sometimes were cleaned right and sometimes were left dirty and missing items like toilet paper tissue etc The phone in the room did not work and it did not get fixed in the kebersihankenyamanan days I was there anytime I needed something instead of calling I needed to come downstairs The tub in the shower was broken so I reported it so I could take a bath it was fixed The towel holder was lose and ended it up breaking and hurting my foot My room was too noise having a balcony facing the street was not a good idea I had a bad experience with an employee named Noemi who insulted my intelligence a few times asking me to call myself the phone company if I wanted my room phone to work that was not my job ;kebersihan;1
 the rooms start to show signs of age though the hotel is quite recent not big but it s not immaculate anymore;kebersihan;1
 The safety box didn t worked as expected but the staff were very attentive and helpful Time to change the safety box ;kebersihan;1
 The scented airfreshners in the head system gave me allergies especially for customers sensitive to smells;kebersihan;1
 The sound of traffic was quite loud even though the window was closed ;kebersihan;1
 The staff wasn t quite friendly and there weren t many options at breakfast;kebersihan;1
 The tea and coffee were cold awful but the waitress made me a kerapihannd cup much better no other issues;kebersihan;1
 The toilet door is not completely closed ;kebersihan;1
 The tray for the shampoo and shower gel inside the bathroom was loose almost falling down which made the shower less comfortable Also when we had breakfast we found some knives were not washed properly There were stains remained on the knives ;kebersihan;1
 The walk to find the hotel Quite off the beaten track ;kebersihan;1
 The whole checking in and checking out was an utter nightmare ;kebersihan;1
 There are many rooms with view to pit But you can open window and have a fresh air But dark a bit No slippers Only Spanish language on TV ;kebersihan;1
 There are not enough hooks for towels;kebersihan;1
 There isn t much to complain about The only thing we had difficulty with was actually finding the hotel initially and that was because the cab driver didn t know where he was going ;kebersihan;1
 There was a rugged welcome for my wife at the front desk as she had not made the reservation and I was not present ;kebersihan;1
 There was a very strong and persistant perfume in the room probably from the cleaning materials ;kebersihan;1
 There was not a thing I could even slightly complain about;kebersihan;1
 There was nothing that we did not like and given the chance we would come back again ;kebersihan;1
 there was nothing to dislike about our stay there;kebersihan;1
 There was practically no separation between bathroom and the rest of the room ;kebersihan;1
 There were a few things on the large breakfast buffet that could be improved For a start the coffee even though Lavazza machines were present was average Maybe it is the coffee the adjustment of the machines the water or a combination of all Furthermore the prepared coffee from the two machines tasted differently This was certainly not the quality I have experienced with Lavazza in other places The quality of the pastries for a hotel in a city like Barcelona which is known for the quality of its bakeries was average They could do better The scrambled eggs and the bacon were overdone ;kebersihan;1
 They only serve scrambled eggs in breakfast You cannot order any other type of eggs And the breakfast buffet was really a bit limited when you ignore all of the sugary crap on display ;kebersihan;1
 They should think to put a king size bed in superior room beds are to small ;kebersihan;1
 Too dark in the lobby and in the corridor Towels could be replaced every two days we put the sign to indicate no change but we were still given clean ones for all the eight days ;kebersihan;1
 Tv in living room to small should be more international tv channels available ;kebersihan;1
 Twin room not available on arrival even though this had been requested via booking com and then through email direct with the hotel A twin was obviously available but for a higher rate which should have been waived in my opinion ;kebersihan;1
 uber could never find this hotel because there s a westferry overground station a westferry road and the hotel is on westferry circus an extra note for directions would be helpful ;kebersihan;1
 Very old fashioned decor Not enough hot water throughout the day for a bath ;kebersihan;1
 Very small Breakfast not very good No food and facilities No usual kenyamanan star facilities;kebersihan;1
 Very small rooms Glass door to the bathroom makes it not very soundproof so maybe not recommended to romantic couples ;kebersihan;1
 Walking into breakfast where the couple of empty tables had still not been cleared was disappointing and gave a very untidy and unclean feel That said the waiter was a delight and food was lovely and fresh best coffee in Paris ;kebersihan;1
 We had a serious leak from the shower ceiling when opening the water Did not really bothered us though Only one couch on a kerapihan people s room sometimes was not comfortable The hotel public areas are very dark dark colors to the walls not much lightning Night club vibe We felt that there wasn t enough light on the room for makeup for example The air dryer was weak better to bring your own ;kebersihan;1
 We had booked a room with a double bed which wasn t available when we arrived we were advised the room had single beds The solution we were offered was to upgrade to another room which we had to pay extra for The room was excellent but we were disappointed we had to pay more However this did not detract from us enjoying a lovely stay at Room Mate Carla We would stay there again if back in Barcelona ;kebersihan;1
 We had breakfast one of the days we stayed in the hotel I stayed in other branches of the Roommate chain before and the breakfast in RM Carla wasn t up to standards The staff was moody my sister actually was scolded as she picked up a croissant with a clean pair of pliers of the hotel but decided to put it back again The woman at the buffet went nuts on her about this Not a great way to start your morning and some parts of the buffet weren t clean The shelves from which you can pick up cups for coffee were sticky and unclean This is really a point of improvement for a hotel that in general is pretty fabulous ;kebersihan;1
 We really loved our days on Room Mate Carla A few things to say about what we disliked kebersihan The bed wasn t double as described on your site that means there are kerapihan kerapihan The breakfast was the same every day keamanan Too much noisy in the morning for us despite the fact we asked a quiet room when booked it ;kebersihan;1
 We should give them the key Whenever we leave the hotel but I do not know why but it is not A big deal And Overall the hotel is really great;kebersihan;1
 We took room with terrace but unfortunately it turned out that terrace is in the back of the building surrounded by the wall so it was not a good choice ;kebersihan;1
 We were not happy that our kebersihan5 year old son could not use the swimming pool after kebersihankebersihanam Despite having explained that he is a sensible teenager nearly six foot tall training to be a life guard Therefore quite able to look after himself ;kebersihan;1
 Web information looked as if the hotel had a bar Drinks were available but you had to ask the night manager to get them for you ;kebersihan;1
 While the hotel is in a classy neighborhood and on a very quiet street it s not on a metro station Staying there in the winter made it not fun to walk back and from the metro station 8 minute walk We ended up taking taxis from around the corner there are plenty in front of Hotel Plaza Athenee ;kebersihan;1
 Why don t all hotel staff ask if you have emptied the safe and not just the mini bar as a necessary question at checkout We almost forgot to check ours ;kebersihan;1
 Wi fi and breakfast are poor;kebersihan;1
 Wifi a little slow but free at least Can t really complain ;kebersihan;1
 Wifi connection not good wifi was desconecting in few minutes all the time;kebersihan;1
 WiFi dropped frequently;kebersihan;1
 wifi is a bit slow in the room ;kebersihan;1
 Wifi was slow and not always working ;kebersihan;1
 wish i could of stayed longer;kebersihan;1
 Would be nice to have the restuarant open in the evenings for dinner;kebersihan;1
 Would like a fridge in the room They only had a wine chiller which wasn t cold enough to store food in because we like to have nibbles after a big day sightseeing ;kebersihan;1
 You pay for every little thing;kebersihan;1
 kebersihan Food debris under the slab on the check in day debris from the hood when turned on a lot of threads from towels kerapihan In common all kebersihankenyamanan days were very good until the last day We had kerapihan extra hours for check out thanks to booking genius status Unfortunately everyone on reception forgot about it although I reminded about that on the day of arrival So from kebersihankenyamanan kenyamanankenyamananam till kebersihankerapihan keamanankenyamananpm I received two different calls from the reception two different visits from housekeeping one of them saw me naked bad mood keamanan Deposit keamanankenyamanankenyamanan GBR is still blocked on my bank account ;kebersihan;1
 A summer weight duvet should be on the bed in July ;kebersihan;1
 Apart from one lady at reception the other staff seemed unsure and were not very helpful I believe this is a new hotel and staff are getting used to it I think the Management should have made sure the staff were properly trained before opening ;kebersihan;1
 As is typical for London the rooms were quite small We had our son stay with us in the junior suite and with the sofa bed out we were all edging around sideway ;kebersihan;1
 Because it was a very new hotel only opened kenyamanan days the bar was not ready But that was not a big deal ;kebersihan;1
 Being new some of the staff were a little blue However tried and after opening several hotels myself understand how much of a task it can be My only real criticism ofrom the experience is that there were no facility to use the hob no pans etc no cleaning cloth and I wish an extra touch would have been fresh milk in the fridge I was also asked for a preauthoried deposit not unusual however could be an issue for travellers who are a little more cost conscious as it has not yet reached my account again yet almost keamanan weeks on ;kebersihan;1
 Check in process was quite lengthy unnecessary deposit required;kebersihan;1
 Check in was extremely slow and check out wasn t much quicker ;kebersihan;1
 Check in was incredibly slow and frustrating even though I had pre booked ;kebersihan;1
 Considerable confusion at check in interrupted by an incoming phone call and I was made to wait the check in computer was not working correctly Nothing terrible but nowhere near good enough ;kebersihan;1
 Could not open shower gell Coffee machine flooded my paperwork;kebersihan;1
 Did not like having to pay a keamanankenyamanan deposit on top of a pre paid room It was easy to get it refunded the next day though ;kebersihan;1
 Dunno ;kebersihan;1
 extractor fan stayed on all night electrical problem otherwise would have givin it top marks;kebersihan;1
 Few more hangers in the wardrobe would be useful ;kebersihan;1
 Fire alarm went off in the middle of the night which is not a problem When we left the hotel via the fire exit we ended up in the garden of neighbouring apartments and had to climb over a fence to reaccess the hotel via the main door Hotel did not check off guests against a list which is dangerous as someone could have been still inside ;kebersihan;1
 First morning workers were making noise at 8 keamanankenyamananam in the room next to our and they woke us up We complained about the incident to reception and although they could not stop them to work that day next days we stayed they did not work early in the morning Unfortunately in the next two days the housecleaner knocked on the door around 9am so we were also woken up Besides these issues the rest of the stay was very pleasant ;kebersihan;1
 Front desk wasn t always the friendliest and rooms a bit small ;kebersihan;1
 Getting in and out of the bathroom was a struggle small doors were hitting I asked to extend my stay by a day or two if available kerapihan days before checkout The gentleman at night suggested I contact the staff tomorrow I thought it strange since he was at the desk already I asked the young lady at the desk the following day She said there were no availabilities that is all I am accustomed to hotel staff offering other options but she came off as inexperienced and quite rude I think unintentional on her part I expected they were filling up but was fine with booking a different type of room or paying extra had it been offered I think she meant there were no similar rooms available at my discounted rate rather than there were absolutely no rooms available Was not keen on that lack of courtesy I stayed somewhere else the following day after checkout ;kebersihan;1
 Good 7 minutes walk from the closest Tube station A bit far when with luggage ;kebersihan;1
 I like to have a breakfast cooked for me and had not realised there was no restaurant at the hotel for breakfast A continental at an extra cost was disappointing ;kebersihan;1
 I was shown an apartment with attached room But when i arrived there was just a studio apartment I was told that booking com made a mistake posting wrong details ;kebersihan;1
 I would have like a tiny shelf in the shower and near the bathroom sink for my lotions and potions ;kebersihan;1
 It is not a hotel but more like a B B no bar no room service no food served no mini bar Even if there is a kitchenette it would have been nice to have a mini bar part of it and some food available just in case No proper breakfeast served either So in terms of value for money it is fair Water was not hot enough in the shower temperature limited and heating was a bit fussy Additionally having a bathroom equipped with the disabled equipment makes it a little less charming and plastic tiles on the floor and walls too Ok that is looking into details as in general the rooms are really comfortable and hotel very close to Paddington station which is so easy to get to and from Heathrow ;kebersihan;1
 Just a suggestion a mirror above the desk dressing table for ladies blow drying their hair ;kebersihan;1
 Just had a disappointing arrival experience We turned up a bit early and room was not ready no big issue but the person that dealt with us on reception was not the most customer friendly Having said that generally the staff were very good;kebersihan;1
 Lack of smile from d staff;kebersihan;1
 Lancaster Gate tube was closed during time of stay ;kebersihan;1
 Literally the only thing was that the bottled water in the fridge was sparkling and we prefer still and that s being extremely picky as it didn t affect us at all;kebersihan;1
 Long check in ;kebersihan;1
 My only complaint would be the positioning of a bright green light in the passageway ceiling possibly part of the alarm or smoke detector system which for us was quite intrusive Not a complaint but if we were staying for a longer period I would go for an upgraded room with more space Although there was a small bar in the foyer it wasn t attended so I guess they don t serve drinks there but not a problem in Central London ;kebersihan;1
 My room had a noisy fan on the bathroom that would stay on for kerapihankenyamanan minutes every time I turned on the light This needs to be fixed ;kebersihan;1
 No AC at the room was too hot and no body can do anything I guess they need to install new AC in the rooms but I don t think they will do it;kebersihan;1
 No breakfast Bar closes early No parking;kebersihan;1
 No breakfast facilities but there are plenty of places to eat in the area so not really a problem ;kebersihan;1
 No breakfast facilities but went to a lovely French cafe;kebersihan;1

 Nothing but few issues with shower;kebersihan;1
 nothing but note the Lancaster gate tube is closed possibly to July kerapihankenyamanankebersihan7 ;kebersihan;1
 Nothing except the rooms and spaces this thing common in London and Europe ;kebersihan;1
 Nothing I can remember;kebersihan;1
 Nothing it was spot on;kebersihan;1
 On site restaurant would be a bonus;kebersihan;1
 One bedroom apartment but no door on the bedroom Rather strange when family were sleeping on the sofa bed in lounge ;kebersihan;1

 Pictures make rooms look bigger than they actually are;kebersihan;1
 Prices high;kebersihan;1
 Really odd request for my driving licence at check in;kebersihan;1
 Reception at this hotel checked me in to the hotel room n the afternoon At kebersihankenyamanan keamanankenyamanan pm they checked in further quests into the same room Total strangers walked in to my guest room when I was undressed Very poor attitude of management and terrible security and in my case total disregard to my privacy Total strangers being given access by reception to my room late at night is reckless and dangerous ;kebersihan;1
 Reception chaotic Extractor fan did not turn off;kebersihan;1
 Reception staff weren t particularly customer focussed baggage guy aside who was very helpful Limited scope for early check in;kebersihan;1
 Renovations on Westbourne terrace obstructing the road to the hotel no food options on site smallish rooms;kebersihan;1

 Room on the small side if more than one person;kebersihan;1
 Room size Only one left ;kebersihan;1
 Room very warm with poor air conditioning Room small ;kebersihan;1
 Room was extremely small The road outside of the hotel was perpetually lined with honking traffic it was so hard for the uber driver to stop and pick passengers up The hotel also does not serve breakfast Lastly the hotel does not even have the facilities to store our luggage for kerapihan nights while we sightsee in paris even though we have booked for the subsequent 5 nights in the deluxe suite In the end the options they gave was kebersihan Ask my pregnant wife to lug the luggage to the train station to store it there kerapihan Find another hotel I cancelled the remaining nights and found a more reputable one that stored our luggage ;kebersihan;1
 Room was too small made it cramped for two people and four suitcases Not unusual for Europe though ;kebersihan;1
 Rooms vary depending on location staff offered little help when it came to facilities not working Be wary if your planning to leave luggage overnight even if you are planning to come to the same hotel as storage is not available for such instances Lack of overnight storage facility was a big let down ;kebersihan;1
 Rooms were very tiny We took a deluxe double studio and a deluxe one bedroom suite They were both very small for the price No room service in the hotel Breakfast as we were told only consists of tea coffee and croissants for 9 pounds a day Hotel is not bad in general but it s we felt that it was a bit overpriced for the size of the rooms and services available in the hotel Overall it was an ok stay ;kebersihan;1
 Rubber mat in shower was covered in mould not sure if it is even needed ;kebersihan;1
 safe in wardrobe to low down and no light in wardrobe ;kebersihan;1
 should but Ashe trey out side the hotel it not good to through the cigarettes ends out side the street No complimentary water for the guests ;kebersihan;1
 Shower in the bathroom leaked water all over the floor;kebersihan;1
 Shower only and tiny bathroom fits only one person at a tine;kebersihan;1
 size of suite was a bit of a joke photo must have been taken with a fish eye lens Definately not big enough for keamanan adults sofa bed would not unfold because it hit the opposite wall Turned it round but then had to climb over it to get to bedroom ;kebersihan;1
 small space;kebersihan;1
 Stayed there twice in May kebersihan7 for 6 days but the air conditioning was sub standard and the rooms were warm ;kebersihan;1
 Studio room was tiny and overstuffed with pillows furniture etc leaving little room to unpack NB nearest Central Line Tube Station Lancaster Gate closed till July kerapihankenyamanankebersihan7 ;kebersihan;1
 Stuff to manage dirty dishes after using the kitchen;kebersihan;1
 The air conditioning was not effective and the room remained warmish during day and night ;kebersihan;1
 The apartment space was very compact so a little more space would have been preferable A bigger bin would have been preserable considering that cooking facilities are provided ;kebersihan;1
 The bar was not open this was never mentioned pre booking and asking for a card payment for extras when none were available i felt was a bit off;kebersihan;1
 The bathroom was a good size however when I had a shower the water leaked under the door onto the bedroom carpet ;kebersihan;1
 The bathroom was a little tight although very modern ;kebersihan;1
 The bathroom was tiny No fun for tall people ;kebersihan;1
 The bed wasn t that comfy I couldn t work out how to use the air con and it felt slightly cramped;kebersihan;1
 The beds and pillows could be a bit more comfortable;kebersihan;1
 The fire alarm went off three times due to system issues during our stay All in the middle of the nights The hotel did not handle it well After the alarms went off there were no effort to let people know that they were false alarms I called the front desk but the no one answered the phone I had to get downstairs to ask the staff for information The hotel does not seem to understand the customers are scared when they hear the fire alarms The no action of the hotel staff is extremely disappointing For this reason alone I will never stay here again;kebersihan;1
 The hotel provided toiletries were not great would bring my own ;kebersihan;1
 The noise was very bad at night from the traffic and the bathroom fan constantly ran which was very loud when when bath room door was shut and lights where off;kebersihan;1
 The only thing I couldn t work out was how to turn off the light in the kitchen area some instructions and or an info leaflet on the facilities would have been helpful ;kebersihan;1
 the only thing I would change is there was no door on the bedroom we put our kenyamanan year old to bed in the main bedroom at 7 pm but as the bedroom had no actual door we still had to be quiet in the living room kitchen area as the suite was very open plan But this wouldn t stop us staying again and isn t something that affected our enjoyment staying;kebersihan;1
 The only thing was perhaps supplying a tea towel and detergent in the kitchen ;kebersihan;1
 The price of a bottle of water ;kebersihan;1
 The receptionist who helped us checked in was the most unfriendly receptionist we ve ever seen and did not make us feel welcomed She was not smile at all and did not tell me whether she s finish using my passport or not and just left it at the side The most weird thing was when I had eye contact with her she was starring at me right into my eyes expressionless I smiled at her and she was just keep starring at me like I m a alien or something However the receptionist who helped us checked out was very nice and friendly ;kebersihan;1
 The room is too small and shower place is crowded and it s hard to find a space to place shampoo and conditioner The hotel doesn t have breakfast place or conference rooms ;kebersihan;1
 The room itself have a connecting door to the lobby toilet when I slept on the sofa bed I could hear the door sound in the morning it really distributing Also the space for the toilet it s too small for me since it was used the space for the public lobby toilet Last there is no place for soap and shampoo in the shower ;kebersihan;1
 The room was quite small but nothing out of the ordinary for London I got a good deal would have been less pleased if I d paid normal rates ;kebersihan;1
 The size of the room was tight with keamanan adults but would be fine with just kerapihan ;kebersihan;1
 The slippers were very slippy on the kitchenette floor;kebersihan;1
 The temperature control in the room was not good it was either too hot with the heating on or too cold in the bathroom if you turned it off Made the stay very uncomfortable Also room was tiny and did not make good use of space No provision in the shower to place your toiletries had to put them on the floor Also the towel rack was so high I needed to climb on the toilet seat to grab a towel Just needs a bit more care and attention ;kebersihan;1
 The triple room was a little small for keamanan adults When the sofa bed was opened out found it difficult to reach the kitchenette Wished there was a good supermarket nearer to this property but we still had a great time thank you ;kebersihan;1
 The walls are a bit thin and you can hear your neighbour at times;kebersihan;1
 The windows are relatively small in the one bedroom suite ;kebersihan;1
 There is a small bar on site to get drinks but no breakfast Therefore would strongly recommend you take something with you for the next morning Rooms have coffee machines and a kitchenette so easy to store food and extras to save the walk possibly in the rain the next morning ;kebersihan;1
 There was no door separating the bedroom to the living area With a baby that s a complete bummer Tge cleaning times were wacky and not very client friendly abd even when raised this point they still didn t do it sooner We had also to pay for a baby coat and not cheap they can be more transparent about this hidden cost and follow other hotels that do not charge anything Small things toiletries were fully changed renewed only at our request room vacuuming could have been better ;kebersihan;1
 Too small and over priced;kebersihan;1
 Towels stored very high in bathroom hard to reach when you are short nowhere to put soap in the shower cubicle ;kebersihan;1
 Unable to check in before keamananpm and check out at kebersihankebersihanam these hours are too restrictive Also being wakened by hotel cleaning staff at 9 kenyamanan5am asking were we ready to check out was an unwelcome occurance A few teething problems with phone and toilet fan not working correctly in room ;kebersihan;1
 Unfortunately if there was anything it would be that there was no tea towel or a small sachet of washing up liquid for washing up considering it was self catering But other than that small thing it was faultless ;kebersihan;1
 Unnecessary deposit required 5kenyamanan Pounds There s no hotel restaurant or room service and only a rudimentary bar ;kebersihan;1
 Upon check in in addition to taking the room charge up front they also took a pre authorization for damages that might happen We were not informed on this matter anywhere while we were making our reservation it is the hotel s responsibility to document and charge these damages not guests responsibility to pay up front for something that might happen They need to clarify their policies ;kebersihan;1
 Very noisy room which kept us awake and woke up our three year old several times with the noise of traffic w hen I told receptionist on departure was told well next time you book we will give you a quiet room Would have liked this in the first place ;kebersihan;1
 Very small bathroom Noisy road which meant we couldn t open a window overnight so the room got quite stuffy even with the aircon on;kebersihan;1
 We travelled with friends and had two rooms side by side Quite a difference in the room sizes especially the bathrooms Our bathroom although beautiful was tiny you could not open the shower door great shower though unless you wedged yourself into the corner by the toilet Fine for a couple of nights but would have been a problem for a longer stay as no space to put anything ;kebersihan;1
 We were not told if breakfast was included Also no mirror in the bedroom so drying your hair was a chore;kebersihan;1
 We were put into a disabled room without notice ;kebersihan;1
 With no restraint a bit pricey and not a central location I know it s London and the extraction fan in in en suite worked only when the light was out Reported fault on arrival but still no fixed after kenyamanan days;kebersihan;1
 Would have been nice to have some sort of snacks available in room;kebersihan;1
 A little further to walk from the Plaza Catalunya station than I had realised ;kebersihan;1
 A little hard to find at first They should have a sign that sticks out more The shower is hard for an American like me to tell which was hot water or cold water ;kebersihan;1
 A little more attention to windows and mirrors ;kebersihan;1
 As the wash basin and toilet area had no doors or walls so a bit awkward if travelling with a friend due to no privacy The we was located in another part anoth a door so that gave the privacy when doing my business ;kebersihan;1
 Avoid rooms at back during weekdays if you don t want to be disturbed by high spirited school sports ground from 8am to kebersihankenyamananpm ;kebersihan;1
 Bathroom window doesnt give privacy;kebersihan;1
 Bathroom without neither window or fan ;kebersihan;1
 Be warned that the bathrooms have no door for the tub For a couple it was fine but for families or friends it s not ideal if you are modest ;kebersihan;1
 Bottled water wasn t replaced after we finished the two small bottles after the first kerapihan days Also the small bar of soap wasn t replaced after it had been used up;kebersihan;1
 Breakfast buffet was not varied enough and I had to eat mostly the same thing every day ;kebersihan;1
 Breakfast was not fresh and under normal standard balcony is unbelievable small and children are not welcomed in the hotel;kebersihan;1
 Broken p lug in sink hard to work out shower controls;kebersihan;1
 Did not like the big glass window in the shower facing the bedroom Very inappropriate ;kebersihan;1
 Double bed was kerapihan singles put together and they slid apart with the slightest touch Room quite small but was expected given price and location ;kebersihan;1
 Ensuite bathroom layout Lack of drinking water in the room ;kebersihan;1
 Everything as great ;kebersihan;1
 Everything to it s best top hotel ;kebersihan;1
 Everything was terrific Breakfast looked good but we did not try it as it was not included and we preferred something lighter ;kebersihan;1
 excellent experience nothing that I didn t like;kebersihan;1
 Fairly basic facilities Glass between toilet and bedroom creating very little privacy ;kebersihan;1
 Free coffee was no good there was no free chocholate in the dispenser;kebersihan;1
 Free WiFi was awful;kebersihan;1
 Glass window shower room to bedroom Sorry designed by a man Most people like privacy whilst showering cettainly not great for two old mother and daughter could be a bit more storage by the beds rathervthan just simple shelf stack ;kebersihan;1
 Hard to find skylink;kebersihan;1
 Honestly nothing really comes to mind a first for a hotel stay ;kebersihan;1
 Hot breakfast could have been hotter ;kebersihan;1
 I could have done without the window into the shower and bathroom Lobby was small but functional and the staff were nice and efficiient I wouldn t call them friendly ;kebersihan;1
 I haven t seen a shower unit like it not enough privacy;kebersihan;1
 I really do not see any bad things but some people wants to stay in the hotel during the day time might be bothering from the noise A school maybe elementary school is located right beside the hotel and you will hear children making noise But the night time is fairly quiet considering its location it is very center of the city ;kebersihan;1
 I would have liked a room with a balcony or some sort of view but as a man who travels a lot with my young son we re used to being shoved off into a dark corner of the hotel but it s a small negative because our stay was enjoyable ;kebersihan;1
 In the shower there is a glass wall meaning you can see the shower and toilet from the bed Not the best for non couples Not the best for couples as well ;kebersihan;1
 In the shower there is a glass wall meaning you can see the shower and toilet from the bed Not the best for non couples Not the best for couples as well The breakfast is nice could be better but was fine ;kebersihan;1
 It felt a little cramped ;kebersihan;1
 It is surrounded by schools on at least kerapihan sides There was a music school on the opposite side of our wall and we listened to piano recitals and chairs scraping most mornings The terrace which is a good size backs onto several school courts Everything turns off when the room key is vacant Including the fridge and it felt like the hot water system too But that might be a normal thing these days ;kebersihan;1
 It only lacks a view ;kebersihan;1
 It s not as sound proof as you make out the room a bit on the small side kept bumping my shoulder on the tv when trying to get by the bed but would stay again;kebersihan;1
 It was weird that there was a glass panel between the shower and the room because the neighbors could see everything what you are doing when the curtains are open But also as two friends it is weird to see each other naked Maybe it s possible to place a foil on the glass but if I went with my partner I wouldn t mind So it s not really a bad thing just something to think about ;kebersihan;1
 little problems with breakfast service and buffee availability while morning rush hours maybe little better TV channels selection lack of Eurosport during Australia Open ;kebersihan;1
 Lovely little hotel;kebersihan;1
 Minimal dislikes suggestions Could have done with a coat hook in the room tables at breakfast a little too close together window from shower to room unnecessary ;kebersihan;1
 more suitcase room;kebersihan;1
 No blanket a bit cold at night ;kebersihan;1
 No elec kettle inside the room Limited choices on buffet breakfast;kebersihan;1
 NO Eurosport in TV window to bath and toilet;kebersihan;1
 No gym sauna etc ;kebersihan;1
 No lobby and small selection of TV programs But since Barcelona has so much to offer these things can be neglected ;kebersihan;1
 No major concerns Again the schoolyard next door can be loud during parts of the day but we were usually out sightseeing ;kebersihan;1
 No major things;kebersihan;1
 No milk in room for tea coffee facilities and limited hanging rail for clothes;kebersihan;1
 no seats in reception area no bar;kebersihan;1
 no window on the street only on the inisde part very small very strange washbasin inside the bedroom ;kebersihan;1
 Not so nice cleaning lady had to ask several time for shower gel etc They don t have bide and there is no tea set in the room They do have free coffee machine in the first floor but less convenient I paid more for the room with balcony what they forgot to mention that this balcony looking to the school yard Due to noise we weren t been able to use this balcony most of the time ;kebersihan;1
 not sure how well the fittings will age as they look easily damaged ;kebersihan;1
 Nothing bad Just note that there are no tea and coffee facilities in the room There is a free coffee machine in the breakfast room but it only runs at certain times if you have an early checkout i e before the 7am breakfast you ll need to find a coffee elsewhere ;kebersihan;1
 Nothing Our air conditioner stopped working but was fixed immediately ;kebersihan;1
 Nothing to mention as it was such a pleasant stay;kebersihan;1
 On booking there was a question about wanting quiet room which I didn t choose should have done as had terrace overlooking a childrens play area school yard thus view from terrace not really what was expected and being woken by children playing wasn t ideal am start It didn t spoil it significantly though;kebersihan;1
 One one soap bar they provide for kerapihan people And small window and dark room cause window is in a corner ;kebersihan;1
 Only that the cleaners started their tour as early as 8am so you have to make sure to put up a do not disturb sign if you re not up early ;kebersihan;1
 Our double bed was kerapihan singles but kept moving apart It wasn t an issue really so didn t bother the staff ;kebersihan;1
 Outside terrace should have been partly non smoking that s my only critiscm;kebersihan;1
 Paid kebersihankeamanankenyamanan euro for a small single room there are better options;kebersihan;1
 Parking might be issue;kebersihan;1
 Price was high compare to kenyamanan stars hotel;kebersihan;1
 really did not have any complaint ;kebersihan;1
 Really everything was ok but when I made our reservation around kerapihan months ago we paid around kebersihankenyamanan5 per night we need one more room for keamanan days and I paid just 8kenyamanan per night so day by day have to be more expensive most probably the hotel wasn t full and that s why was this price ;kebersihan;1
 Room overlooked school playground so a little noisy from about 8am fine for us as up and out but might not suit someone wanting a lie in ;kebersihan;1
 Room very small Sink in bedroom Bathroom dark and small;kebersihan;1
 Room was a little small and signage at the front of the hotel is almost non existent so if you re not looking you ll walk right past;kebersihan;1
 Room was really small and cramped With the double bed you basically had some crawl space on either side and at the foot but there was literally no other space No place for your suitcase No lobby space no gym Not sure why it s a four star hotel Lack of facilities alone should make it a three star ;kebersihan;1
 room was tiny pictures don t do the justice deserves keamanan stars but surely not kenyamanan;kebersihan;1
 Rooms could have been a bit more large;kebersihan;1
 rooms small a little expensive;kebersihan;1
 Satellite TV options could be better Many of the channels like the news channels could be activated But its a small matter as I have a habit of listening to the new in the morning as I wake up and before I sleep ;kebersihan;1
 Shower arrangement Shower stall clear glass that can be seen through from beds into shower and sinks Great if married or lovers but for kids it would be all wrong Small one door lobby entrance easy to drive by ;kebersihan;1

 Size of room could have been larger ;kebersihan;1
 Slightly insufficient extraction in the toilet ;kebersihan;1

 Smoke from neighbouring room ;kebersihan;1
 Some traffic noise from street but manageable ;kebersihan;1
 Somehow a little sterile rooms but nice in its own way ;kebersihan;1
 The air circulation was strange in the room changing from cold to warm air quite rapidly;kebersihan;1
 The air con was on central a bit of hussle with managing a good temperature ;kebersihan;1
 The balcony faces a school playgrounds very noisy in the morning The fridge only had water A single bottle of champu was the only toiletries provided no soup ;kebersihan;1
 The balcony over looking school playground which we wernt aware of;kebersihan;1
 The bathroom shower glass was see through into the bedroom so no privacy to use the toilet etc;kebersihan;1
 The bed was large and comfortable The location was pretty good We were upgraded to a room with a balcony which was nice Room bathroom was a little dark and small with some cleanliness issues Overall we had a nice stay with friendly staff Breakfast was ok limited options ;kebersihan;1
 The bed was not very comfortable and the room was very small It was difficult to move my bag into the room due to the room size ;kebersihan;1
 The bedroom could have been a little bigger ;kebersihan;1
 The beds were clean and very comfortable but would of been better if it was a double bed rather than kerapihan singles pushed together;kebersihan;1
 The breakfast is expensive You find cheaper around the hotel ;kebersihan;1
 The coffee tea machine ;kebersihan;1
 The distance to the metro ;kebersihan;1
 The double room size is quite small No drawers no hanger for jackets in the hallway The bathroom is not fully closed There are doors for the small room with the toilet no toilet brush no ventilation no window There are no door for a bath tub which is quite inconvenient to enter not recommended to elderly people This lack of privacy is maybe ok for couples but not sure if it would be for others ;kebersihan;1
 The glass shower facing the bedroom was a bit weird but not really an issue ;kebersihan;1
 The hotel breakfast is expensive and did not look very good ;kebersihan;1
 The hotel is next to a school that can get a little rowdy but isn t a huge issue at night ;kebersihan;1
 The hotel was small including our bedroom This was fine for us as a couple as we only stayed in our room to rest and sleep but if you are not in a couple you may want a larger room with a bit more privacy there is no door to the bathroom only the toilet ;kebersihan;1
 The internet was slow ;kebersihan;1
 The modern style went a bit too far with the open concept shower in the middle of the room You may like it Rooms were a bit small but that is to be expected in a city hotel ;kebersihan;1
 The noise from the road traffic ;kebersihan;1
 The only complaint I can think of is the lack of parking but in the centre of Barcelona it was expected ;kebersihan;1
 The only thing that I could say keeps me from giving this a kebersihankenyamanan kenyamanan is the restroom situation ;kebersihan;1
 The partition between the shower and the bedroom is made of clear glass which is probably inconvenient particularly if the people staying are not intimate as the room had two single beds ;kebersihan;1
 The place of wash stand in the room is poor ;kebersihan;1
 The room cards didn t always work;kebersihan;1

 The room was small Also strange to have the sink outside the bathroom ;kebersihan;1
 The room was tiny and the window opened into a deep well formed by the adjacent surrounding buildings;kebersihan;1
 The room we had looked over the playground of a school so you can be woken up by the noise if you re there during term time There wasn t much variety of a hot breakfast there were some eggs bacon and sausages but I didn t feel like eating them every day ;kebersihan;1
 The rooms could have been a bit cleaner There was no ventilation or window in our bathroom so the room and especially the bed felt a bit moist ;kebersihan;1
 The school behind the hotel sometimes created noise Especially when adults were playing on the basketball courts at night It was hard to shut out their noise ;kebersihan;1
 the sink was not in the restroom;kebersihan;1
 The size of the room and the bathroom was shocking at first and the style of decor high tech in a rather depressing colour scheme contributed to it My single room overlooked a tiny courtyard but it was quiet as a result so because of this and general good standard I liked it ;kebersihan;1
 the wall was too thin it wasn t really sound proof because I could hear what other people was doing in their rooms Room was smaller than expected but I can t complain about it since everything was well planned and organized in the room ;kebersihan;1
 There are no rooms with keamanan beds available would be good for small families with a little child ;kebersihan;1
 There s nothing that we didn t like;kebersihan;1
 There s nothing to do see in the hotel itself but who needs that when you re in Barcelona Breakfast was good but too expensive as there are many breakfast options nearby ;kebersihan;1
 There was a constant odor in the room I alerted the staff but nothing could be done since the hotel was fully booked Kind of pricey ;kebersihan;1
 There was no hood in the toilet but even a toilet freshener and a toilet brush either It was disturbing that the bathroom was in the room and the door was completely transparent glass there was no cover on its surface Although we hang out the do not disturb sign the air condition cleaning staff knocked on the door The last day before we left they didn t replace the run out paper tissues and didn t put up toilet paper either Unfortunately the daily cleaning didn t include mopping the floor although it was spotty And a small thing it would be nice if the hotel can obtain a balance to measure the luggages to avoid repacking them at the airport due to the weight limit ;kebersihan;1
 There was nothing I did not like about this hotel and it s wonderful staff The only improvement might be for the hotel to have a small bar or restaurant However this was not really an issue given the extremely close proximity to numerous bars and restaurants and there is kerapihankenyamananhour access to free complementary hot drinks;kebersihan;1
 There was nothing particular I did not like Maybe narrow spaces overall;kebersihan;1
 There was nothing we didn t like but could we suggest a street sign outside the hotel making it easier to spot from a distance ;kebersihan;1
 There was sometimes an unpleasant smell from the toilet room ;kebersihan;1
 They don t have a restaurant;kebersihan;1
 toilet smelled;kebersihan;1
 Twin beds size could be bigger The AC is a central control I mean we had to ask the front disk to switch it on and they have the control for the AC temperature set point It will be handy and obvious if we can control it from our room I think this policy is only apply during the winter season ;kebersihan;1
 Ventilation of the bathrooms Constant stink ;kebersihan;1
 Very small rooms and over all hotel;kebersihan;1
 View from terrace room wasn t great and glass showers so no privacy if your travelling with friends;kebersihan;1
 We can see teh bathroom directly from the bed through the window This suits only for the couple not for the business ;kebersihan;1
 We were very happy nothing to dislike ;kebersihan;1
 We would have loved access to a kettle cups and saucers in not available as standard then available on request ;kebersihan;1
 Wi fi connection was average at best depending on the location you were having within the room The rooms are rather small for the price they re charging and from the pictures that are publicly displayed on its page you cannot quite tell the dimension of the room Breakfast was ok but fairly standard with too little variation whatsoever The AC system is coordinated at a central level and even if you play around with its settings you do end up either with a too hot or with a too cold room the air flow being continuous ;kebersihan;1
 Without lobby;kebersihan;1
 Would prefer a separate bathroom ;kebersihan;1
 kebersihan Marked parking only for kenyamanankenyamanan vehicles yet hotel has kerapihankebersihankebersihan rooms where s the extra spaces kerapihan Be careful not to place money card into car park machine which is for visitors not residents keamanan Layout of split wardrobes clothes section could be improved with a shelves in the bottom of the wardrobe kenyamanan Bathroom shaving mirror should be of extendable type as too far away from basin 5 Table top ironing board should have instructions 6 The desk chair seating height cannot be changed 7 The room menu does not encourage healthy eating as both the full English breakfast and the Continental breakfast are the same price;kebersihan;1
 kebersihan Parking The parking is busy and there was construction site on the hotel this should be temporary but getting and out is not easy and Parking is not included in the price kebersihankenyamanan per kerapihankenyamanan hours if you do not want to park in the hotel then you have to walk across a dual carriage way good luck with that kerapihan There is only shower in the apartments There is bath tub Despite the fact that I have been promised a bath tub and this was confirmed via booking com when I got to the room there was no bath tub and I have been by the reception and the manager that there are no bath tubs in none of the hotel rooms So if you want need a bath tub this is not your hotel In the room options on booking com it says Bath tub or Shower but be aware that there are no bath tubs keamanan The design is nice and fancy inside the hotel but then what s the point when you sit in the loo and there is a 5 cm gap between the loo and wall The door stopped 5cm before completely closing Guess what there was no main door separating the toilet from bathroom Use your imagination what could this be like if there are two of you in the room Also if you shut the toilet door the bathroom will have no door thanks to its strange design Its a sliding door between the bathroom and the loo with no main door separating the toilet from living room And as you may guess the rooms are not that big at all I had a Superior king room kerapihan or one step from toilet and you were in the living room kenyamanan There was limited shampoo and soap in the bathroom If you need more then you had to call and kind and hard working I am assuming overloaded staff with their duties will bring you the extras in no time a waiting time of 5 to kebersihan5 minutes 5 Location wise it is not much great You have to drive about kenyamanankenyamanan 55 minutes including traffic in Busy London to get to hotel from London city centre ;kebersihan;1
 kebersihan We arrived at kerapihanpm time that is possible to check in we got told to wait as cleaner is cleaning our room this is ridiculous as they have kebersihankerapihan kebersihankenyamanan to clean what was worse is that more than kebersihankenyamanan groups and couples arrived in that time and got checked in immediately so we waited at reception and got told to sit and itd take kebersihan5mins max We ended up waiting ONE HOUR We were very disappointed as a kenyamananstar hotel should be better organised kerapihan In the morning i was just out of the shower and my partner was asleep and i hear our room door opening and its the cleaner They came in before check out time approx 9 keamanankenyamanan kebersihankenyamananam I was absoulutely outraged I was in my underwear getting changed when the staff completely intruded our privacy This is not a kenyamananstar service and id advise anyone plannnig to stay here to not even bother The image of the place isnt even close to the representation of the service I told the reception about the cleaner coming in and she didnt even seem surprised She said im sorry about that and that theyll investigate Ive had no contact from them and doubt i will Horrible experience ;kebersihan;1
 A little business like and very modern sharp to feel cosy especially for a couple romantic getaway No bath in bathroom Not enough tea coffee milk provided Not happy with breakfast would prefer waitress service a bit like a rugby scrum when we went down on Sunday morning queues no tables Found it difficult to find things toast took ages and the breakfast items did look taste like something from a cheap cafe ;kebersihan;1
 Air con was faulty in the King Studio was offered to move rooms but we only had a few hours left to stay so we was offered a discounted second stay to make up for it Car park is a bit Cramped;kebersihan;1
 As the systems were brand new the check in process was a little slow but wasn t a big issue Car park is a little small and cramped worth getting there early if you can ;kebersihan;1
 Bathroom door was difficult to use;kebersihan;1
 Breakfast buffet was badly managed Constantly running out of food and no one keeping and eye on situation ;kebersihan;1
 Breakfast Chose to go elsewhere after a disappointing first impression;kebersihan;1
 Breakfast was a buffet but was basic Only egg option was scrambled For kerapihan99 per night it could have been better Room kenyamanankenyamanan7 shower leaked all over the floor in the bathroom ;kebersihan;1
 Breakfast wasn t worth the money I didn t think No effort made to replenish what had ran out and livery little to choose from ;kebersihan;1
 Can t answer this question because i loved everything;kebersihan;1
 Car park has about kerapihankenyamanan spaces for hundreds of rooms people had parked stupidly and made it difficult to even manoeuvre around it This is my only negative for this hotel ;kebersihan;1
 Car park too packed I struggled to leave the hotel car park as cars were not parked sensibly resulting in ticket expiring then holding up the traffic to get out of the car park while I waited for help ;kebersihan;1
 Car parking limited ;kebersihan;1
 Charge for local calls little farther from city center no addition restaurants around besides what s at hotel ;kebersihan;1
 Charging kebersihankenyamananpund for parking next door only 5 pound at travelodge I request top floor I they check me in at kebersihanfloor I request late checkout they can t The room very bad view car park No bath only shower they charge YU for sevices room service breakfast they all charge extra service Any way I don t think I will go back again ;kebersihan;1

 Clean;kebersihan;1
 Could hear a beeping sound in the night Think it was the lift ;kebersihan;1
 Couldn t really find fault with it ;kebersihan;1
 Disappointed with the bar Minimal staff operating On the night that I stayed there was only one personnel serving the bar aswell as serving drinks for the adjacent bar I waited over kerapihankenyamananmins to get served without any acknowledgement Frankly Not good enough ;kebersihan;1
 During dinner the waiting staff were otherwise engaged and it took a long time to attract attention to take our orders and pay the bill I ended up approaching them at the bar to pay before returning to my room ;kebersihan;1
 Food was good but a bit exspensive;kebersihan;1
 Free parking for guests;kebersihan;1
 Getting across the road via tunnel from tube to hotel;kebersihan;1
 Guest information was supposedly on the TV but very difficult to find;kebersihan;1
 Have nothing to complain about;kebersihan;1
 Hidden car park fee of kebersihankenyamanan per day upon validating your ticket and checking out this was not explained to us upfront when checking in even when we asked about parking This is very expensive given overall price of hotel stay Also there is an error in marked car park bays blocking the way out English buffet breakfast was not replenished staff had to be prompted to do so leaving our breakfast to go cold whilst waiting for the items to be replaced Need to be on top of food quantities and ask kitchen to start replenishing before items completely runs out ;kebersihan;1
 Housekeeping for the second time costing me a small fortune by cleaning my room despite Do Not Disturb sign on the door Additionally they don t understand the mistake they have made because they do not speak English so when trying to rectify it end up continuing to do damage until a member of staff who can communicate between both parties explains Medication now unusable some damage to trainers but overall just a monumental hassle both dealing with the mistakes and then having to rectify them in my own time i e prescription medication and other medications being lost or rendered unusuitable for use ;kebersihan;1
 I didn t like that king superior bed was two single beds put together The only thing I didn t like about my experience ;kebersihan;1
 I didn t like the fact that the robes were not that comfortable and also the check out time was a bit early for me ;kebersihan;1
 I tried to call the reception to get me tooth brushes and tooth paste but the receptions kept cut me off so We couldn t even brush our teeth The products inside the bathroom were missing as well as sleepers and that wasn t good enough service for the price we payed ;kebersihan;1
 I would like a door to the bathroom proper ;kebersihan;1
 It was a Saturday night and there were some people nearby taking advantage of that I was woken at 6am by some banging for someone to open a door in the corridor I have not factored that into the ratings as that is going to happen from time to time on a Fri Sat in a hotel ;kebersihan;1
 It was hard to find a parking space;kebersihan;1
 Little expencive the phone in our room did not work when we were trying to get room service ;kebersihan;1
 Location is good because it s close to a tube station and cinema But the views are awful ;kebersihan;1
 My concern is more off personal preference than a complaint I guess The beds were a little to firm for my liking It wasn t to uncomfortable I just like a more pillowy mattress ;kebersihan;1
 my previous visit some six weeks ago has not addressed the issues I itemised and raised then so must be work in progress same goes for the contractors still working in the car park ;kebersihan;1
 N outside seating when ordering an omelette that s what you got no garnish nothing asked for milk to be sent up for tea and coffeevamdbthey charged kerapihan 59 forvit;kebersihan;1
 No comments all oz perfect ;kebersihan;1
 No Complementary water Paid Parking is it is not in a crowded location Linen Laundry must be improved or changed;kebersihan;1
 No door to separate the bathroom from the rest of the room Breakfast was ok but not great ;kebersihan;1
 No fried eggs or sunny side eyes for breakfast when asked i was told it would cost 6 5kenyamanan absolutely crazy We were put in a disable friendly room not nice Our room was next to the exit door that was constantly slamming could not sleep The hotel cancelled kebersihankenyamanan parking ticket for this not good enough;kebersihan;1
 No limited wifi very frustrating staff couldn t resolve issue;kebersihan;1
 No outer door on the bathroom and the shared sliding door between the shower and the loo Easy chair in bedroom was uncomfortably hard on the bottom ;kebersihan;1
 No outlet for dryers in bathroom;kebersihan;1
 No supermarkets very near you have to walk far;kebersihan;1
 Not sure why the hotel charges for parking ;kebersihan;1
 Nothing really kerapihan single beds rather than a double but was comfy so not a complaint ;kebersihan;1
 Nothing to comment about;kebersihan;1
 Nothing to do with the staff but felt uncomfortable with a drunk and aggressive customer and not confident the staff could have dealt with it if the behaviour got worse not that they should have to of course ;kebersihan;1
 Nothing to improve on the hotel was perfect for what I needed it for ;kebersihan;1
 Nothing very good stay;kebersihan;1
 Only minor issue regarding the housekeeping They need to check their services Sometimes they forget to do everything they should do during room services Delay in cleaning the room Forgot to replace towels It happened only one time but the hotel manager in duty reacted quickly and apologized;kebersihan;1
 Only one coffee machine which was slow so caused a queue across the entrance to the dining area ;kebersihan;1
 Ordered breakfast in the room which was late but food was good;kebersihan;1
 Ordered breakfast to room which never came They lost our order Breakfast eventually came which was very unsatisfactory It was thrown on a plate Our phone in the room didn t work either which we asked for it to be fixed but never done We asked reception to book a taxi for us but they forgot to Other guests had the same issue with taxis More attention to detail Really friendly service from the lady on the reception desk called Tara Parking should be free for hotel guests ;kebersihan;1
 Our bathroom door was stuck but the staff managed it pretty fast ;kebersihan;1
 Our stay was to short ;kebersihan;1
 Parked in the hotel car park and had to pay kenyamanankenyamanan for under kerapihankenyamanan hours ;kebersihan;1
 Parking Limited spaces and no prior warning ;kebersihan;1
 Parking on site should be free;kebersihan;1
 Parking was first come first served if I wasn t able to park there I would have been stressed out;kebersihan;1
 Parking was somewhat limited and you were unable to book a space which is slightly inconvenient however Staff were very friendly and did everything they could to find you a parking space Would be great if the hotel would let you book parking even if it was at a premium rate to provide piece of mind when travelling particularly late We arrived at midnight and would like to have known that we definitely had a car spot rather then just having to wait and see ;kebersihan;1
 Price of the Beer;kebersihan;1
 Screen in shower should be bigger or extendable to stop flooding the bathroom floor Only enough supply for kerapihan cups of tea Where as has to ask for more for a cuppa in the morning ;kebersihan;1
 Shower leaked out of the cubicle onto the rest of the bathroom floor had to mop it all up with another towel the mood light turns other lights on aswel as the blue mirror light if there was a option to turn just the blue mirror light on that would be so much better The sky channels didn t work but they did offer to change our room but because we were only staying for the weekend we didn t change Apart from that it was a wonderful stay;kebersihan;1
 Some of the furniture;kebersihan;1
 Staff were not particularly competant spoke poor English Breakfast was not worth the kebersihankerapihan charged Premier Inn offer much better quality ;kebersihan;1
 Team couldn t cope with the peak of guests wanting breakfast;kebersihan;1
 Teething problems in the kitchen restaurant staff were very good but unfortunately the Chef was off ;kebersihan;1
 The airco is often not felt as the sun is shining right into the room Cleanliness in the room was below the level of a kenyamanan star hotel Even after mentioning it to the Room Division Manager we could see the difference however it was still not completely clean Finding a hair in my breakfast plate was all but fun It took my appetite away ;kebersihan;1
 The beds were a bit hard;kebersihan;1
 The breakfast was a bit disorganised ;kebersihan;1
 The breakfast was quite expensive for the stuff they were offering and the trays were empty when we got to have breakfast The receptionist was really confused to find our name even when we showed our booking We stayed in a room for disabled people and was fantastic but I d say the toilet get wet too much so we wonder if a disabled person would be ok as they could easily slide into it ;kebersihan;1
 The chef shouting service to the staff during my meal was irritating ;kebersihan;1
 The fact that the staff kept mistakenly entering my room They were very kind with the apologies though This happened twice though;kebersihan;1
 The food at the horel s restaurant ;kebersihan;1
 The food was not up to par was the only downside Cooked breakfast did not taste good and both me and partner left more than half a plates worth;kebersihan;1
 The hotel is right next to a busy dualcarage way so can be noisy ;kebersihan;1
 The hotel seems ill equipped to cope when a big event is on at Wembley Although the staff were trying their best some fundamental design flaws ment that things did not go smoothly The check in desk is too small and badly situated so when you were queuing you were blocking the lifts There was not enough seating in the dining room for breakfast and we had to wait ages for a table and there is only one coffee machine to serve the entire dining room Lunch in the restaurant was ok but service very slow even though not many other people were in there And there was a complete disaster when it came to ordering a cab to go to the concert which basically ended up with us being kenyamanankenyamanan mins late I think this could be a good hotel with better thought and management but definitely not kenyamanan star service at the moment ;kebersihan;1
 The Hotel was fabulous however the check in procedures need to be improved massively It took keamanankenyamanan mins to check in The trainee staff member was not supported by the one remaining trained staff member who despite the trainee struggling left her to continue faffing with our check in Despite having paid in advance for the room they tried to take a kebersihankenyamanankenyamanan deposit for any potential room service for the kerapihan separate rooms booked This process was also not completed correctly with a charge of kebersihan57 kenyamanankenyamanan being put onto my account I will check that this has been removed but didnt give me any confidence in the procedures The trainee was polite and helpful but she just needed careful mentoring through the process The whole hotel was beautiful but it all seemed under staffed and the staff require more customer care and procedure training ;kebersihan;1
 The landscaping needs to be finished for the full effect Using the hotel s other entrance when ready will make a big difference when it s raining ;kebersihan;1
 The location is a bit far from the centre of London ;kebersihan;1
 The only thing I didn t like was when the breakfast came in the morning The toast was cold ;kebersihan;1
 The process for using the the TV totally sucks They need a better process ;kebersihan;1
 The room smelt of cannabis Only one sliding door between toilet and shower so no privacy ;kebersihan;1
 The shower was a bit small and we ll designed given the space ;kebersihan;1
 The staff at the reception seemed not very familiar with their jobs There was often long queue at the reception Although the team indeed delivered their service with friendly attitude they could not handle the regular check in check out proceeding in an efficient and organised way Overall I felt that the hotel was understaffed and did not provide sufficient training to the employees therefore the service quality was seriously damaged ;kebersihan;1
 The staff was very sarcastic The staff could improve in his attitude The only problem we had was quantity of sugar or milk but wasn t too much of an issue The shower room toilet was lovely but the only problem was the glass panel for the shower being too short of distance so the water escapes very easily and it is hard to maintain the cleanliness of the bathroom as well as enjoy the shower ;kebersihan;1
 The tv features didn t work in two rooms ;kebersihan;1
 The view from our room of the bins but it couldn t be helped due to location;kebersihan;1
 There are not enough car parking spaces to the number of rooms which will cause problems to guests that arrive later in the evening No matter how careful you are you will flood water in to the bathroom via the sliding shower door Do not undertand why both full English and Continental breakfasts are the same price ;kebersihan;1
 There is no change in the breakfast menu on any day during my stay of kenyamanan nights this needs to be looked at by the management ;kebersihan;1
 There is no door for the toilet only one sliding door between the shower the toilet seat ;kebersihan;1
 There Wasn t any thing at the hotel that I did not like ;kebersihan;1
 They need more staff serving at meal times Breakfast a big let down Everything had run out when we got there and very slow at topping up if at all Not enough tables for the size of hotel Had to queue kerapihan5 mins just to get to the coffee machine Staff that was there were trying their best just not enough of them ;kebersihan;1
 Travelling into London was a bit tiring each day and quite far away from other destinations ;kebersihan;1
 TV didn t work Dan sorted it but it s a regular issue Shower leaks water everywhere lame last week in a different room Phone in room didn t work Evening meal good but dessert left waiting ages wasn t very warm and ice cream very melted was refunded Bike in gym ok but TV radio nothing would work to listen to used my phone Breakfast chaotic After kerapihan trips through the toaster still warm bread Coffee machine causes a bottleneck ;kebersihan;1
 tv didnt work no tea making facilities in room;kebersihan;1
 TV in room was awful Almost impossible to use the smart features and the staff advised it s not compatible with Netflix ;kebersihan;1
 TV in the room was complicated and lost signal after a few hours and didn t work rest of our stay Staff attempted to fix it but with no luck Were offered a room swap but given we were only staying one night it didn t feel worth it Perhaps expected of a new hotel however for the price we were paying it should have worked The breakfast offering could have been better ;kebersihan;1
 underground station does not have lift far from city center;kebersihan;1
 Unfortunately although the breakfast looked appetising my husband didn t enjoy his cooked breakfast as majority of the food he chose was cold most probably due to the lid of the heated container being left constantly open ;kebersihan;1
 Very little to complain about But on certain peak dates some nights are over charged for what you get in return ;kebersihan;1
 View from room could be better but not terrible;kebersihan;1
 Wait in the restaurant for meals far too slow ;kebersihan;1
 We ordered food it took an hour and a half to get out the food was absolutely non edible and we we re not happy with the service after spending nearly 9kenyamanankenyamanan during our stay The manager came and halved the bill 8people and only one person at the table had there meal We were still charged kerapihan7 for drinks even Dow we were kebersihan hour late for our taxi and we were still being charged as our taxi waited out side and we told the manager this and still got charged even Dow it was there staff that held us back We came back to the hotel after thr first night and ordered keamanankeamanankerapihan in alcohol and when we went to get another vodka we were told no because it was past kebersihankerapihan kenyamanankenyamanan so my aunt had to practically beg for a vodka as she dosent drink anything else I didnt understand why as we were spending money in there hotel Also I payed for my room on arrival and I was told I owed the full amount plus more before I left I was so embarrassed and it was said in front of the whole place The lady handed me a recipt and tryed to show me what i owed and i had already added 5kenyamanan to my account that covered my bill I was made to feel so small it was totally uncalled for I ve stayed in park plazas before and never had such a bad experience ever Also I stood at the reception standing my cornor as I knew I didnt owe kerapihan95 that she tryed to take The bathroom was rediculous and the shower soaked the whole bathroom when you used it and the carpet in our room was soaking wet when we arrived I honestly do not complain And its my first time to write a review but I felt it was appropriate ;kebersihan;1
 Well Hotel is in industrial zone so there is nothing to be seen Which do not make it negative because hotel is excellent from inside ;kebersihan;1
 What I did NOT like was the following Bacon not cooked folded from the freezer and cooked in the oven so the bacon is not cooked in the middle The toaster not quick enough people queuing for toast Ate in the restaurant on four occasions the service from the kitchen was terrible Over ten minutes for bread and butter and keamanankenyamanan minutes for a main course This is a new hotel but the kitchen staff need to turn the food around in a quicker period of time The price of wine and brandy is extortionate no house wine of a reasonable price Bar seating is badly designed and failing;kebersihan;1
 When hotel personal entered room whilst sleeping ;kebersihan;1
 When you turn on the smart tv it shows you a menu of features including watching tv but sometimes it was difficult to choose watch tv from the menu as it is not automatically;kebersihan;1
 Would have much preferred to be served tea and coffee at breakfast as the coffee machine wasn t particularly nice Also a minor point a little more attention to detail when clearing and setting tables for breakfast ;kebersihan;1
 kebersihan The first remark when we arrived was You don t get any points because you booked through Booking com You would have gotten 5kenyamanankenyamanan points for this visit kerapihan The air conditioning leaked all over the carpeting Luckily the temperatures in Vienna were cool and we could open the windows Which allowed noise from other rooms keamanan The bathroom a The shower squirted water all over the place and it leaked at the handle b The tub has very high sides and was most difficult to get into c The floor of the bathroom was very slick especially when the shower leaked water keamanan The beds were very uncomfortable but due to our tiredness we were able to sleep kenyamanan After our 5th night at the hotel service changed because as we were informed the switch over to Best Western had taken place The result We lost Wi Fi couldn t connect Breakfast changed from an elegant table service including made to order eggs to a typical and certainly ok breakfast buffet 5 We weren t informed that if the desk called for a taxi the taxi fare would cost an extra kerapihan 6kenyamanan euros ;kebersihan;1
 keamanan bed room cramped for keamanan people but given value for money this wasn t a big deal;kebersihan;1
 A bit dated the decoration could do with a refresh ;kebersihan;1
 A minor point but why does a hotel of such quality and style and at these prices think it a good idea to have a bottle of mineral water in the room stating Welcome and in small letter cost keamanan 9kenyamanan Euros Many establishments do it and it is penny pinching ;kebersihan;1
 A slightly larger room would have been good ;kebersihan;1
 A staff member grumpy and room smelt dusty and hot;kebersihan;1
 Air condition was the worst I ve experienced for many years Practically it was window open or shut ;kebersihan;1
 All a bit old fashioned soap dispensers in the bathroom impossible to use no bar for the late night drink after the opera;kebersihan;1
 Bathroom shower screen leaks water across the bathroom floor ;kebersihan;1
 Bathroom was a bit dated Water leaked all over floor when you showered but didn t ruin our stay ;kebersihan;1
 Bedding is not very comfortable But other than that good experience ;kebersihan;1
 Both my husband and I have had super short break in Vienna made special by this hotel and there is nothing we disliked ;kebersihan;1
 Bottles of water welcome you every day but it comes as a surprise when they ask you to pay this should be made clear ;kebersihan;1
 Breakfast dining room was small Tables for couples plentiful but larger parties not all catered for Watched people having to wait for tables on occasion That said did not effect us ;kebersihan;1
 Breakfast is fine but no changes After kenyamanan 5 nights could be boring Parking only in the parkhouse very near costs kerapihankenyamanan day ;kebersihan;1
 Breakfast room was a little too overheated ;kebersihan;1
 Breakfast tables are a bit cramped for all the food that is served to your table Unfortunately the furniture in the bedroom is laid out really badly For example my bedside table concealed the safety box which only left one small drawer to use The only other set of drawers was next to the other side of the bed which was difficult to access and not sufficient space The safety box did not work properly the batteries were flat but even changing them couldn t make it work The TV channels in English consisted of CNN news and nothing else The bath shower was small and narrow with a half glass door which meant water spilled all over the floor toilet seat with each shower ;kebersihan;1
 Cannot think of one thing;kebersihan;1
 Compared to other kenyamanan stars hotels in western Europe seems a bit overpriced maybe due to the location and or peak season considering the hotel does not have any facilities such as restaurant room service SPA center car parking ;kebersihan;1
 Construction works on the street temporarily I suppose ;kebersihan;1
 Dated and rather tired decor ;kebersihan;1
 Decor could do with a little spruceup although love the beautiful princess Viennese style;kebersihan;1
 definitely it needs renovation internet is very weak and slow inside rooms Matress are not comfortable may be needs to be changed breakfast menu has to be varied through the days despite it is really good but still it is quite boring to eat the same every day ;kebersihan;1
 Even though the weather was cool room wa too warm;kebersihan;1
 Every thing is all right;kebersihan;1
 Fighting over the room type;kebersihan;1
 Flat hard narrow beds Poor plumbing Bathrooms undersized Average breakfast ;kebersihan;1
 forgot to take in room breakfast order ;kebersihan;1
 Front desk staff was not very friendly or helpful when needed on a couple of occasions Always sitting in back and felt put upon when making requests Breakfast staff were excellent however ;kebersihan;1
 Hard to park around need to park in garage walk kebersihankenyamananmins;kebersihan;1
 Hotel is old and room is small just a garret and near the stairs look different from Booking pics Breakfast is average a little simple;kebersihan;1
 Hotel needs renovation ASAP But still better than Hilton ;kebersihan;1
 Hotel was a little unsophisticated and a bit noisy if the windows were opened We also had a very poor quality shower which was a disappointment to us There were very limited bar facilities ;kebersihan;1
 I booked a room wth kerapihan beds In fact it was a suite with a large double bed and a sofa bed The beds were very hard Apart from that and that there was no TVs we could understand nothing in English apart from cnn news I would not fault this property;kebersihan;1
 I cannot find something that I did not like Honestly I tried but I found nothing to complain about ;kebersihan;1
 I don t think they should charge for the bottle of water in the room ;kebersihan;1
 I had omitted including breakfast in our reservation Paying for breakfast separately was pricey I felt kerapihankenyamanan euros each One gentleman at the desk was not particularly friendly Gave me a rather flip answer that was not helpful ;kebersihan;1
 I tried hard to think of something not so good but I just couldn t;kebersihan;1
 I was expecting a bigger room from the pictures it looked bigger For this reason I found the price a little bit too high ;kebersihan;1
 I was sharing a suite with my mum who is 8kerapihan years old and I requested a room with a shower but unfortunately they have no rooms with separate shower cubicles All the rooms have bath tubs with shower attachments and my mum was unable to use this I also found when I used the shower in the bath tub the water was escaping through the glass door onto the floor no matter how careful I was The bathrooms are very pretty but could do with an update ;kebersihan;1
 Internet is not working properly ;kebersihan;1
 It was a bad smell in the bathroom The room was made up just ones during my staying ;kebersihan;1
 It was such a wonderful stay but there was only one annoying thing you had to keep logging into the wifi all the time ;kebersihan;1
 It will be better if hair conditioner is provided;kebersihan;1
 Lack of meals ;kebersihan;1
 Lack of restaurant or room service Still a lot of nice restaurants around ;kebersihan;1
 maybe they can upgrade their Hairdryer it s a bit out of style;kebersihan;1
 No bar or restaurant apart from breakfast ;kebersihan;1
 No fresh fruits to breakfast Taf pillows ;kebersihan;1
 No negative points ;kebersihan;1
 No on site parking Could not control the room temp which was too warm ;kebersihan;1
 not a single one;kebersihan;1
 Not enough natural lighting in the room;kebersihan;1
 Not really a full service hotel Small lobby More of a bed breakfast ;kebersihan;1
 NOTHING ALL WAS EXCELLANT;kebersihan;1
 nothing all was fine;kebersihan;1
 Nothing everything were great but the breakfast was poor of chicken because we are muslem we didnt eat meat with;kebersihan;1
 Nothing really only the Wi Fi kept dropping out ;kebersihan;1
 Nothing we didn t like at all Perhaps having some small business cards on the reception desk would be welcomes by guests as they are easy to carry in wallets ;kebersihan;1
 Perhaps a wider range of pillows for creaky old necks ;kebersihan;1
 Person who greeted us at reception late at night was a little grumpy Doesn t help when you are tired after travelling a long way and a little worried about having found the right hotel However other staff were wonderful ;kebersihan;1
 Personally I found the bed mattress too firm and the pillow too spongy but this is common in many hotels so I think it must be down to me ;kebersihan;1
 Room decor was horrendous Faded pink and gold bathroom from the seventies;kebersihan;1
 Room furniture could use an refresh ;kebersihan;1
 Room slightly dated and shower fixed position ;kebersihan;1
 room was very hot and hard to regulate temperature;kebersihan;1
 Rooms may get hot but it is not something to bother Breakfast could be better ;kebersihan;1
 Rooms rather hot ;kebersihan;1
 Shower powerful and glass panel too small so toilet often wet after showering Breakfast runs out of croissant often Extra sofa bed in suite supposed for third adult not even due to different levels of sofa mattress ;kebersihan;1
 Shower screen over bath leaked across the floor ;kebersihan;1
 small and slow elevator ;kebersihan;1
 Small claustrophobic room No window with a view ;kebersihan;1
 Temperature of the shower ran cool whilst in use not a major issue ;kebersihan;1
 That I was only there for two days ;kebersihan;1
 The airconditioning system is a bit noisy Better seals round the shower ;kebersihan;1
 The bath tub needs replacing or refacing ;kebersihan;1
 The bathroom could be improved by having a few hooks on the walls ;kebersihan;1
 The bathroom was a little squishy but not a major issue ;kebersihan;1
 The bed is not so comfortable due to the plastic sheet Air con wasn t cold;kebersihan;1
 The bed was large and comfortable but a little low ;kebersihan;1
 The breakfast room was tight especially when many guests came together at the same time Breakfast was not as varied as at Best Western Kaiserhof Hotel Being located in the center of the city and in close proximity to restaurants and cafes it can get a bit noisy if you have the windows open ;kebersihan;1
 The catering staff were very nice and helpful but had very little English ;kebersihan;1
 The d cor was not to my taste though I appreciate that it was in keeping with the age and style of the building There was a smell of cigarette smoke indoors I presume from the neighbouring pavement cafes Our room on the first floor was quite dark due to the proximity of neighbouring buildings ;kebersihan;1
 The electrics;kebersihan;1
 The fee was high and when you make reservations you have to move from site to site when looking for it The information in different sites may be different Because the price for the room was high I understood the parking would be free of charge or included in the prise That is why the feeling went down when paying another nearly kerapihankenyamanan euros on top when checking out ;kebersihan;1
 The heating could not be controlled so the room was too hot Smell of cooking seeps into the room ;kebersihan;1
 The mattress was quite hard and the duvet was heavy There was often a smell of cigarette smoke in the room ;kebersihan;1
 the noice in the street early morning with lorries providing the shops But the hotel cannot help this to solve in the middle of the city So we cope with this of course ;kebersihan;1
 The pictures were a bit better than the hotel itself ;kebersihan;1
 the room could be more comfortable;kebersihan;1
 The room I had was at the top of the property and I could touch the ceiling flat footed A tad claustrophobic ;kebersihan;1
 The room tended to get very warm at night with little way of reducing the heat apart from opening the windows Luckily there was very little street noise The lift was exceedingly slow to arrive and soft to deliver Being on the first floor we could arrive at reception via the stairs before the lift could ;kebersihan;1
 The rooms are small and the furniture is a bit rundown for the price Other than that we were happy ;kebersihan;1
 the sound in the street in the early morning Deliverances at bars and adjacent restaurants with rolling carriers of bottles and more Start at 6 am ;kebersihan;1
 There was no desk and the a c didn t work well ;kebersihan;1
 There was nothing not to like just GREAT all round and I would stay again andwill look out for the Hotel Group Hotels elsewherein Germany and Austria;kebersihan;1
 There was simply nothing to complain about except maybe the size and busy ness of the elevator but that s a trifle and it added to the charm of the place ;kebersihan;1
 They are replacing the carpets which are needed but they began a bit to early ;kebersihan;1
 They moved me to a front room when I did not like the darker room in rear of building Very considerate ;kebersihan;1
 Thought the airport transfer was included but sadly it wasn t;kebersihan;1
 Twin beds were rather narrow but perfectly comfortable ;kebersihan;1
 Was very hot in room Conciege told me how to turn radiators off but was still very hot ;kebersihan;1
 We had a great time so no adverse comments from us ;kebersihan;1
 We had booked twin room but it was not available for the two first nights so they upgraded us to junior suite for the rest two nights The room was lovely but the bed was creaky ;kebersihan;1
 We had to check out very early the following morning but forgot to inform the kitchen so we didn t manage to get the breakfast box on the way to the airport ;kebersihan;1
 We travelled by car and parking in the neirborhood had very narrow parking places Hence we had to choose parking near opera theater which is quite expensive ;kebersihan;1
 We were unaware that it was impossible to get anything to eat apart from breakfast I arrived back mid afternoon after a few hours sightseeing looking forward to a cup of tea and a cake or a sandwich but was informed there was nothing available so had to go back out to the bakers along the road ;kebersihan;1
 Wifi dropped in and out but this was a minor problem ;kebersihan;1
 Wifi in my sisters room was patchy but fine for us on the top floor;kebersihan;1
 Wifi kept dropping out but not a big issue Had to keep reregistering It did connect quickly though ;kebersihan;1
 Wifi was a bit patchy at first D cor is a tad dated ;kebersihan;1
 a bit far from the station but paris hotels are alll like that;kebersihan;1
 A good walk to main attractions but the metro is at the top of road but always busy ;kebersihan;1
 A little noisy with drilling next door but it had stopped between 5pm kebersihankebersihanam and on Sunday ;kebersihan;1
 Air condition vent facing bed;kebersihan;1
 Air conditioning was advertised but it was not switched on I asked about it it was out of season but we were there early April and it was quite warm ;kebersihan;1
 Air condotion very low and Wifi dosnt work perfectly;kebersihan;1
 Bad All the furnishings were well above the usual standard but being such a small room may be a little over crowded with the bed side lamps Plus the fridge stock is about 5x retail price which is a shame Ugly Parking outside hotel is practically impossible There is a multi storey car park kerapihankenyamanankenyamanan mtrs away for approx keamanankenyamanan per day;kebersihan;1
 Bathroom bedroom proportions somewhat off bathroom too big for bedroom area Big issue toilet sat too high from the ground needs to be brought down about keamanan kenyamanan inches or so ;kebersihan;1
 Because we were on the top floor our angular shaped roof close to the windows caused a bit of discomfort when trying to open close them The desk and tea station were also positioned in this area so it made eating and preparing tea coffee a bit challenging The wifi could ve been a bit better Certain apps like my South African banking app wouldn t connect None of these issues were horrible though and I would still stay in this exact room again ;kebersihan;1
 Breakfast buffet overpriced kebersihan9 for the quality ;kebersihan;1
 Breakfast could be better ;kebersihan;1

 Breakfast seemed to be cold;kebersihan;1
 Breakfast small room ;kebersihan;1
 Breakfast too poor for this price And hairdryer in the room doesn t work ;kebersihan;1
 Breakfast was just okay nothing interesting but fine if you don t have anywhere else to eat ;kebersihan;1
 Breakfast was slightly pricey;kebersihan;1
 but a bit far from the attractions;kebersihan;1
 Choice of restaurants limited as compared with other locales in Paris ;kebersihan;1
 Cleaners would just knock on door and come in before we could answer One time I wasn t dressed properly and that could of been extremely embarrassing they should only come in if the sign on the door is on to say we want cleaning Breakfast staff don t speak that great English and can be quite snappy at times maybe just the ones that were on that day for kebersihan9 you can get MUCH better else where But nice pastries ;kebersihan;1
 Coffee machine was broken We asked at the reception to check it and they said they would fix it but when we came back to our room in the evening it was still broken We also had an empty box of napkins in the bathroom It was a little inconvenient We got a room for handicap people though none of us are handicap Hence we had a very inconvenient shower because it was designed specifically for handicap people Moreover the closet didn t close and hence it was hard to get the lights off which were inside the closet The design of closet was very inconvenient because safe was just in the middle of it so we couldn t fit our jackets inside ;kebersihan;1
 Complained about a broken light as it wasn t possible to turn it off without taking the card out to turn all the lights off Complaint was ignored the first day so complained again we were given the option to change rooms but told it would be fixed the next day so decided not to move however it wasn t fixed A small complaint and sometimes things go wrong but it is how they are dealt with that counts disappointing ;kebersihan;1
 Didn t like the nespresso there were no instructions on how to use it We did eventually figure it out but the coffee was like tarmac not very pleasant needed about keamanan coffee whiteners each but there were only kerapihan left out Also no hot water for tea bags very disappointing The breakfast room breakfast was a bit disappointing very limited choice especially for kenyamanan hotel no museli first morning very poor fruit salad and the hot food not great This spoilt what would have been a fantastic stay ;kebersihan;1
 Does not have a view;kebersihan;1
 First night the room was extremely cold but after adjusting a c it was fine ;kebersihan;1
 Hotel sign was tiny Our cab driver had to call the hotel to find out where exactly the hotel was on the street Our room A C wasn t working properly Advised the front desk about the issue but nothing was done about it Had to open windows to let the cool air in The manager advised us that the whole building s AC system was set to Winter mode heating only therefore the room temperature could not be adjusted She then told us to switch the controls off and leave the windows open Although the hotel manager at that time was very apologetic and was very informative about the issue the front were quite disappointing that they gave us false hope that it will be fixed ;kebersihan;1
 hotel was near rome metro station but rome metro station is far from tourist spot must have transfer the metro line and takes kerapihankenyamanan minutes by metro ;kebersihan;1
 Housekeeping did not do our room one day Reason unknown ;kebersihan;1
 I asked for a special request to surprises my girlfriend with a cocktail and some fruit for when we arrive and then on check out I got charged keamanankenyamanan euros for a bowl of grapes and a cocktail everywhere else I have stayed they do this complimentary if you make a special request The area around the hotel can be quite scary at night with groups of men hanging around It was intimidating when I went out in the evening with my girlfriend because they would say things to us in french as we walked past and then laugh The area around the hotel is full of sex shops and escorts Try to avoid this area and stay closer to the centre of Paris near the Champs Elysees The room service is overpriced and there are not many good places to eat surrounding the hotel ;kebersihan;1
 I haven t found a parking near the hotel but that s not an issue as there is a parking lot 5min walk from the hotel ;kebersihan;1
 I loved everything about it Nothing to dislike Just one tiny thing is that you can hear doors closing and people who walk heavily in the corridor ;kebersihan;1
 I n in Paris keamananx per month and have stayed in many places I paid extra for the upgraded room for five night stay but it room kebersihankenyamanankebersihan was very tight You could barely get around it with the small desk in front Not kebersihan9 sq m no way My brother staying at same hotel for only one night paid less and got upgraded to a suite from basic Seems most people get upgraded anyway so save your money when booking Big confusion when ordering a taxi to airport which came late and could not take credit card and could not be billed to room Led to unneeded airport stress Breakfast at EURkebersihan9 is expensive ;kebersihan;1
 I wish they had a small fitness area ;kebersihan;1
 Ice machine;kebersihan;1
 In the morning we could hear a fair bit of noise from other residents but this was at a reasonable hour so not to bad;kebersihan;1
 It could get a little noisy when people are waking up opening and closing doors early mornings Sound proof rooms would have been extra perfect ;kebersihan;1
 It did not have good soundproof walls for sure for a kenyamanan star hotel Too much noise First night I could hear people having sex at night Then next day fire alarm was on so loud The last night there was a party going on what staffs refer to as opening of hotel celebration in the lobby Had an early plane to catch the next day but it was loud until midnight Shouldn t the staffs have noticed the guests about this event Althought the facilities were nice it was quite loud overall during our stay ;kebersihan;1
 It does not justify giving less than a kebersihankenyamanan but breakfast is overpriced I would recommend 7 euros for pastries and coffee instead of kebersihan9 for a buffet or to keep it at kebersihan9 but with more service and choice such as a chef making omelettes and crepes ;kebersihan;1
 It was very hot in the room the AC was not cooling at all The staff changed our room and then the AC was better;kebersihan;1
 just a little things one night lamp next to the bed was not working then we came in the room we found only one bathrobe and it took some time to make work our nespresso machine But the staff was very friendly helped us with every question in 5 min and even gave us an adapter for EU socket cause we forgot ours ;kebersihan;1
 Just a small recommendation if I may The day we left we asked at the reception for a taxi to the airport The fee we payed however was kerapihankenyamanan more than for a tipical parisian taxi Maybe it is not a big difference but it leaves you with a bitter taste It wasn t a taxi and it didn t have a meter Probably the hotel management could consider some other correct taxi service ;kebersihan;1
 Kept getting woken up through out the night with noise could hear toilets being flushed through the day and night Damaged time in the bathroom We made a complaint about the noise on the Friday was told by a staff member that the Manager would get back to us which never happened Since we arrived home from our trip the staff have called us liars saying no complaints were made etc Between the Hotel and Booking com our issues complaints are still not resolved If you are looking for a hassle free holiday I wouldn t recommend staying here ;kebersihan;1
 Limited choice of breakfast esp hot food and we were given a disabled room where the toilet was too high ;kebersihan;1
 location and the size of the room ;kebersihan;1
 Location but not much can be done about it ;kebersihan;1

 No water katel at room and gym as well;kebersihan;1
 Noise from hallway backyard Bathroom was insanely cold the tiles on the floor was very very cold We had to have the shower running to heat up the bathroom We think the windows where poorly isolated and the cold from outside had a free pass inside The staff where not helpful with finding another room for us ;kebersihan;1
 None to report ;kebersihan;1
 Not so clean despite rating Noisy plumbing Noisy building ;kebersihan;1
 Nothing everything about this hotel was fantastic ;kebersihan;1
 Nothing is negative about this hotel ;kebersihan;1
 Nothing not to like except the tea in the room ;kebersihan;1
 On kerapihan occasions we had to wait downstairs while they cleaned our room Coincidently 5kenyamananAUS had gone missing during our stay from a wallet that never left the apartment A staff member had brought the wallet to us upon check out and said she found it in the room we would have addressed it if we had noticed prior to arriving at airport ;kebersihan;1
 Only a small point but room was a fraction tight for space but I only paid for a standard room ;kebersihan;1
 ONLY the standart room was for two people not enough large ;kebersihan;1
 Our room was tiny Shower seemed not always clean traces of mold on the gray wall on closer inspection Yellow spot on one of the pillows which was seen only afterwards ;kebersihan;1
 Parking in the vicinity is a nightmare and you eventually need to leave your car in a paid car park close by There is not even a place in front of the hotel reserved to stop your car and drop off your bags ;kebersihan;1
 prefer wider choice of coffee and tea sachets in the room;kebersihan;1
 Quite some internal noise due to plasterboard walls ;kebersihan;1

 Telethon signal was bad in z room and there was some noise in z evening like slapping doors heavily ;kebersihan;1
 The area is not the best but we encountered no problems at night though we made sure not to be out too late Also the room was a bit tight in space but we didn t really mind ;kebersihan;1
 The bed was too soft;kebersihan;1
 The brakfast buffet wasn t the best I had but also not to bad Still worth the money ;kerapihan;1
 The breakfast buffet looked more appetizing than it turned out to be On the day we ate there nothing was fresh ;kerapihan;1
 The breakfast was terrible the bread and bagels where so stale you could break a window with them you literally couldn t cut the bagels with a knife Waist of money ;kerapihan;1
 the cold but we managed;kerapihan;1
 The hotel charged my Credit Card twice first when I made the booking and a second time after the stay even though it said that there won t be any charges before arrival Also the sink was broken so the water could nt run off we told the receptionist but no one came to fix it ;kerapihan;1
 The hotel could provide a garden courtyard they have the spaceGreat staff;kerapihan;1
 The hotel is perfect in all ways ;kerapihan;1
 The hotel is too loudy You can hear neighboors having sex people talking in the passage as if they were literally inside your room Very disappointing on this aspect I was woken up several times in the night Not acceptable for a kenyamanan stars Serious issue to be considered by the owners It is a pity because the street is very calm bur noise comes from inside ;kerapihan;1
 The hotel room we had was a slightly dark room ;kerapihan;1
 The lady in the reception when we arrived was not very helpful nor was she service minded but all of the other staff members we dealt with were amazing ;kerapihan;1
 The location could be better There is not much to do around You always need the metro The overall decoration was very modern and you don t feel like you are not staying in France Definitely not for Paris lovers ;kerapihan;1
 The noise from the corridor could be heard ;kerapihan;1
 The room is just a bit to small for kerapihan person but then again the bed was big and comfi ;kerapihan;1
 The room must have backed onto the kitchen or other staff area so it was a little noisy at times ;kerapihan;1
 The room was a bit small but this is typical for Paris hotels ;kerapihan;1
 The room was a bit small crowded but was still great and the architecture of Paris doesn t really lend itself to large spaces ;kerapihan;1
 The room was a quite small ;kerapihan;1
 The room was smaller than we expected and there was no view what so ever Not a lot of sunlight could come in And kerapihan times the power went off and it was off for several hours ;kerapihan;1
 The room was too small It looks much better in pictures but in reality it s hard to walk there alone but even talking about kerapihan people Our shower door was broken and when I told that on reception I was told to just put a towel on the floor Definitely not something that a kenyamanan star hotel should say Also once we were going on a walk and wanted to take a cup of tea with us but on that moment there was no hot water the receptionist saw that we were struggling with the hot water machine and she didn t even offer to help In the rooms not always tea coffee and water were renewed ;kerapihan;1
 The room was very small I could not really move in it ;kerapihan;1
 The rooms are very small The breakfast was too expensive for the value ;kerapihan;1
 The rooms could have been soundproofed better ;kerapihan;1
 The sound prove was terrible I could hear all the neighbors showering or flashing sound I was light sleeper so first night was not a good night at all ;kerapihan;1
 The toilet isn t ideal ;kerapihan;1
 The variation in prices is silly For a standard room we paid an average of kebersihankenyamanankenyamanan euro night we heard another guests bill was 8kenyamanan euro and the advertised price was kenyamanankenyamanan9 euro Prices for breakfast room service and drinks were much too high we went elsewhere patisserie in little square at the end of the street turn left from reception is very good Standard room is quite crowded so you may prefer a larger size but small is typical for Paris Some noise issues with other guests ;kerapihan;1
 The wall of the room is not very soundproofed sometimes we can hear people walking in the corridor But this didn t disturb us at all as most time especially in the evening it was very quite ;kerapihan;1
 There is nothing I could complain about ;kerapihan;1
 There is street parking and a parking garage on the corner which is keamanankenyamanan euro a day The breakfast is overpriced ;kerapihan;1
 There was construction going on outside the hotel This cant be helped unfortunately Our room was very small compared to others we saw when other guests were coming and going There was only a handful of english channels 5 6 No gym which was a let down seeing as it was a really nice hotel it would have been a great addition ;kerapihan;1
 There was no Sign indicating the hotel as it was our first time;kerapihan;1
 There wasn t anything that we didn t like about this property ;kerapihan;1
 they could supply more info for good places to eat and see in the area;kerapihan;1
 They said they upgraded our room but it s still very small the room doesn t even have enough space to place two open suitcases the room is only good for one person to stay They didn t clean the carpet there are cookies on it and they forgot to give us towels and water bottles When we call the front desk they were not helpful they ask us to write a memo to their hotel manager or write it online and this is exactly what I m doing right now ;kerapihan;1
 To give something to improve The cleaning staff took a lot one day to clean the room but it is also true that I entered the room during the day disrupting service;kerapihan;1
 too small room really small wardrobe;kerapihan;1
 Towels can be refreshed ;kerapihan;1
 Typical Paris sized room like in any other hotel;kerapihan;1
 Unfortunately the breakfast was expensive for the range on offer;kerapihan;1
 Very noisy The staff made a party during our stay There was very loud music till kebersihan kenyamanankenyamanan am Besides we could hear every sound in rooms around There was a room service but we couldnt order coffee ;kerapihan;1
 Very small and Old hotel This hotel cannot say kenyamanan stars I am not so happy when I go in this hotel I not understand why many comment say this this fantastic hotel ;kerapihan;1
 very small room and bed;kerapihan;1
 Very small room Staff inconsistent;kerapihan;1
 Walls are a bit thin and rooms aren t huge ;kerapihan;1
 We didn t do the breakfast because it was too expensive ;kerapihan;1
 We got there after 8 keamanankenyamanan pm and the bar wasn t open I m not sure if this was an exception or not but we would have loved to relax in the bar It looked nice ;kerapihan;1
 We had some very noisy people beside us during the night but when we contacted reception they sorted it out and we were upgraded to a different room the next day ;kerapihan;1
 We travel keamanan This my girl 8 year old They say must buy other room So bad;kerapihan;1
 Wifi didn t work ;kerapihan;1
 Wish it had more amenities or if we could use other Best Westerns with pools spas ;kerapihan;1
 Would have liked English speaking channels on TV ;kerapihan;1
 A few of the little details that make a 5 hotel No toothpaste in the bathrooms kebersihan tissue left in tissue box kebersihan receptionist was quite rude and sounded very exasperated on the phone to me ans my sister not good ;kerapihan;1
 A few things took away from the premium experience kebersihan lengthy attempt at upselling on checking in kerapihan we didn t have the credit card with us that the reservation was made with which they had requested us to bring this took longer than it should have to resolve it can t be that unusual an occurrence keamanan nice pool and spa area but not all the pool functions were working jaccuzzi and hydro fountain were out of order kenyamanan water pressure wasn t particularly good in the shower 5 no toilet brush in the bathroom ;kerapihan;1
 A little noisy at night during the weekend as the street is very animated;kerapihan;1
 A proper coffee maker in the hotel would have made the room perfect ;kerapihan;1
 A window that could be opened in the room;kerapihan;1
 All exceedingly good;kerapihan;1
 Also we were told breakfast was included so we went and I wished we hadn t the food was horrible and I wonder how badly you could make eggs and bean on toast then went to check out and was told it was keamanankeamanan extra for our stomach aches not really pleased with that part ;kerapihan;1
 Although some staff were wonderful the hotel clearly lacks a well structured central management that is a must for a hotel that claims to be 5 Some staff are wearing casual clothing or check Facebook on their iPhones in front of guests At breakfast it was all very chaotic and nobody seemed to be informed who should do what One staff member one night even complained to us about long working hours and the lack of motivation of fellow co workers Shockingly unprofessional for such a hotel For the price charged I would strongly recommend other hotels in London ;kerapihan;1
 Although staff were extremely helpful and friendly it was little bit too much in the breakfast room with a lot of staff watching our every move when eating I can not fault the staff and most people like that level of attention ;kerapihan;1
 bar is not intimate enough suggest smaller spaces roof top bar closes too early cinema should be available to residents if not being used with double sofas and more relaxed seating in part;kerapihan;1
 Bar staff very slow one member asked for our order then he went off to get someone else as he wasn t sure of what he was doing Breakfast cold ;kerapihan;1
 Bed huge but not the best hotel bed I ve ever stayed in Milk not refreshed in fridge so couldn t have an early morning cuppa Grrrr Found the hotel lacking in atmosphere but could be down to time if year and not many guests staying there;kerapihan;1
 being an old courthouse was special but the main hall gave a bit of a could feeling My room looked out directly to the windows of another block As I was outdoors allday it didn t bother me too much;kerapihan;1
 bit of a trek to nearest tube station;kerapihan;1
 Breakfast could have run a little smoother but didn t taint the stay in the slightest ;kerapihan;1
 Breakfast was cold even ordered off the menu on the second morning and still arrived luke warm ;kerapihan;1
 Breakfast was very poor Cold plates cold food and poorly cooked no toast other than by using a DIY toaster my toast was stolen by another guest and poor service very low grade Not 5 star You can get a much better breakfast for less money at nearby cafes I told the staff this on check out but no response from management to my home telephone or email after five days despite assurances that my comments would be passed on Clearly a hotel that pays no attention to guest s comments We shall not return Here is a tip the nearby Hoxton Hotel offer much better value for money ;kerapihan;1
 Broken lift meant it took longer than expected but now I m Just being picky roof top bar closing early but understandable as we were the only table ;kerapihan;1
 Car park was expensive but very convenient;kerapihan;1
 Check in nearly put me off completely to the point I wanted to leave before I got to the room View of a brick wall from the room kenyamanankenyamanan7 But that s London The shower although it looked good was like a hangover from an old fashioned B B Jump around to get wet Not the sort of thing I expect in a 5 hotel;kerapihan;1
 Couldn t fault them on one thing All in all was a perfect stay ;kerapihan;1
 De g r reklam f r bowlingbanan p sin sida men talar inte om att den kostar kenyamanan5 pund i timmen hutl st Inomhuspool allt annat ingick men inte bowlingen The bowling is kenyamanan5 pounds per hour Very expensive ;kerapihan;1
 Depending on demand the rooms can be quite expensive got a good deal through booking com The housekeeping could ve been a bit better for a fairly top end hotel only little things that were unnesassry really;kerapihan;1
 Didn t enjoy the breakfast;kerapihan;1
 Didn t get the opportunity to use the gym and spa facilities ;kerapihan;1
 Didn t love the pillows A good pillow selection is important ;kerapihan;1
 dirty bed sheets when we arrived and dirty towels;kerapihan;1
 Earlier book in keamananPm was late after long journey;kerapihan;1
 Felt like a budget hotel trying too hard to be something it s not There s quite a grand feeling on entering the lobby but this quickly dissolved Scruffy staff on reception desk when checking out dirty unironed shirt scruffy jeans We were offered onsite parking when we called to say we were struggling to find parking We weren t informed of this charge until checking out keamanan5 for overnight Breakfast lukewarm buffet Atmosphere vacuum in dining room Some nice music would have helped Lobby decor appealing however in room the patterned graphic carpet and black furniture felt very 9kenyamanan s bachelor pad ;kerapihan;1
 Felt the staff were very poorly trained I did not receive 5 star service ;kerapihan;1
 Food Service ;kerapihan;1
 Gin and tonic served with warm tonic and no cucumber or lime Waiter looked out of place and didnt speak any English When I went to pay by card he said they would only accept cash Cashier was then very rude ;kerapihan;1
 Great to have Sky available in the room but disappointing that there were no on demand or pay per view movies I appreciate that this is a relatively minor issue ;kerapihan;1
 Hair in my breakfast Poor communication Luggage came an hour after we arrived in our room Poor response from management promised a call from the manager waiting still charged full price for breakfast Very disappointed paid a premium price but certainly a sub premium device Absolutely dreadful;kerapihan;1
 Having to knock to get in after hours Not cool The reception staff are a little too watchfull of comings and goings Its awkward;kerapihan;1
 Having to pay a kebersihankenyamanankenyamanan deposit upon arrival;kerapihan;1
 High pitched sqeeking Noise coming from a laundry room near room keamanankebersihankerapihan was a bit annoying in the night;kerapihan;1
 Hotel is very new and lacks atmosphere empty bar and lack of some basic amenities eg maps at concierge desk newspapers Some very odd practices like bath mat slippers placed beside bed each evening Swimming pool was out of order during our visit ;kerapihan;1
 Housekeeping was a little forgetful forgot to clear all wet towels one day ;kerapihan;1
 i called room service at kebersihankenyamanan kebersihan5 service closed at kebersihankenyamanan keamanankenyamanan it rang and rang and someone just picked it up and put it down again not how customers should be treated at least talk to me if it is too late to order ;kerapihan;1
 I cant think of anything ;kerapihan;1
 I didn t know that when I got there I had to put kebersihankenyamanankenyamanan deposit down which they didn t tell me before Also parking is very expensive and you have to wait kebersihankenyamanan kebersihan5 minutes to get your car back;kerapihan;1
 I found the bed too firm more to with my taste than the quality bed Breakfast overpriced at kebersihan5 pp for basic breakfast buffet ;kerapihan;1
 If you wanted to do bowling you had to pay and there was no cinema so we couldn t watch a film and the rooftop bar was not open until keamanan o clock the Paul was out of order and it was cold in the swimming pool when it opened;kerapihan;1
 In general there was not enough staff for this fully booked hotel Staff were trying there best and more but you could see that they had to rush all the time Indoor pool kebersihan of the main reasons i booked this hotel was closed for maintanance Rooftop bar another of the reasons I booked this hotel was occupied by a private party so we could not enjoy it Roomservice took almost one hour to bring the food Breakfast buffet was very small and limited and the option of the a la carte breakfast was not clear at all there was one menu hidden at the cash desk and ONLY if people specifically asked for it the staff was willing to show it Whole breakfast room was run by kerapihan persons and this is absolutely not enough according to the size of the breakfast room If I compare same price quality hotel in for example Tokyo this was truly not good Hope the hotel will improve these points soon ;kerapihan;1
 It is a shame there is not a good restaurant but really just a cafe extension to the bar The rooms are comfortable and clean but they are decorated in that bland grey way of all hotels these days A bit more Shoreditch originality would be welcome ;kerapihan;1
 It lacked in the finer touches you would usually expect of a 5 hotel In my opinion the hotel is a kenyamanan The hairdryers should be replaced it is one of those awful ones where you need to keep your finger on the button for it to work Our minibar was a cupboard with a bottle of tap water There wasn t even a fridge Tea and coffee making facilities are in the room but I ve been in other lower rated hotels where they have Nespresso machines this would be a nice touch A bath would also be a good addition sometimes a shower just doesn t cut it at a hotel and the robes look like they were made for children so it does lack a little luxury ;kerapihan;1
 It was a little pricy for keamanan nights but still wonderful;kerapihan;1
 It was a shame to have to close the very expensive curtains during the day for privacy as there weren t any nets or blinds at the large window For a 5 star hotel one would expect a welcome bottle or two of water to be provided especially on a hot day ;kerapihan;1
 Junior suites have small window against a wall only So we downgraded to a double with stunning city views Small thing a couple of hooks to hang your jackets would be helpful in the room ;kerapihan;1
 Just the pool water should had been warmer;kerapihan;1
 Management talking down to staff in front of customers bar menu being very dirty soiled service very slow in the bar when we were the only customers ;kerapihan;1
 Maybe need signage around the entrance to the pool to explain you use the room key to gain access We were a little disappointed we couldn t use the roof terrace bar on a lovely sunny evening as there was a private event Perhaps if we had been told about this at check in that would have been good The terrace is also right outside some of the bedroom windows so people can see straight in ;kerapihan;1
 More coffee sachets would have been a good touch ;kerapihan;1
 Most of facilities were closed like the bowling lane or the swimming pool while this is the reason why I selected this hotel ;kerapihan;1
 My room wasn t cleaned;kerapihan;1
 No fault with the property itself other than it would of been nice to if had a floor guide to hand i e telling you where things were in the hotel bowling outside bar etc The website needed more information i e spa prices bowling prices cinemas prices menus ;kerapihan;1
 No real issues;kerapihan;1
 Nothing Perfection;kerapihan;1
 On arrival I was told I had to pay kebersihankenyamanankenyamanan deposit aswell as the total hotel price this would be refunded on departure I explained this was not explained on booking com On departure the man explained the money would appear in my account same day Later that day I returned to the hotel to aak why my money had still not been returned and the manager explained the receptionist had made an error and the money would now take 5 kebersihankenyamanandays to return back to my bank this was dissapointing I booked this hotel for the rooftop bar I called the hotel to ask if this would be open and they said if it isn t raining Upon arrival the weather was lovely and I was then told the rooftop bar is closed all winter this was very annoying and I would not have booked this hotel if I was told before booking The parking was over priced ;kerapihan;1
 On booking confirmation it said mini bar although I wasn t expecting a full bar A bottle of water would of been a bonus all that was in the fridge was milk for our coffee Also the turndown service was a lovely touch it was again slightly disappointing that one bottle of water and one small chocolate was left for me and my husband to share For the price of the night stay I felt it was a little mean;kerapihan;1
 On checking in at reception Staff seemed new to their roles as he was rather slow checking us in I think they may have been in training perhaps Also language barrier bit problematic perhaps our accents Irish confusing for the staff maybe Also main bar needs to be restocked very poor selections of drinks available Informed by another couple that their Evening meal on FRiday at 8pm took almost an hour to be served when this one couple were the only ones in the restaurant Housekeeping let us down as they forgot to restock T tray which had no Tea nor biscuits no coffee in our friends room either;kerapihan;1
 Only a couple of little problems Sunday am the shower was just about tepid the same applyied to pool area showers they were cold Saturday evening These things didn t change my overall enjoyment of hotel ;kerapihan;1
 Only had bottled beer at the bar Nothing on tap ;kerapihan;1
 Only improvement I would like to see is a Nespresso machine in the room as I like an espresso to wake me up in the morning Other London hotels I have stayed at of a similar standard have them so I have come to expect one ;kerapihan;1
 Only small issue I had was he roof terrace wasn t open due to the weather Wasn t wet just a little cold yet other roof terraces were open until he vacinity;kerapihan;1
 Parking is available at extra cost Even temporary parking at the front of the hotel is prohibited but there is a small access area to the underground car park so although the staff park the car for you the car is taken down by lift it would be helpful if the hotel sent out detailed procedure to those guests booking a car park space ;kerapihan;1
 Poor lighting in bathroom and the mirror difficult for the shortsighted amongst us ;kerapihan;1
 Restaurant food just ok Rooms are fine but lack real comfort;kerapihan;1
 Restaurant was OK and the Guy serving was very polite and efficient but was very inexperienced Also there were things missing which are usually standard at good to top quality restaurants There is sadly a general lack of experienced hotel staff ;kerapihan;1
 Robes could have been more cosy towelling long sleeves No ear buds No water in room;kerapihan;1
 Roof garden was too busy to go on every time we tried;kerapihan;1
 Rooftop bar was closed for private function with no prior warning to guests this was the reason why I selected this hotel and couldn t use it Asked staff if I could go up for breakfast instead but no luck Was informed the courthouse police station bar was open until kerapihanam but when arriving at kebersihanam it was closed so couldn t use that either ;kerapihan;1
 Room got hot even with air con on and if we had the window open there was fans outside the room making a lot of noise;kerapihan;1
 Room seemed a bit bare and lacked character Pillows could have been better ;kerapihan;1
 Rooms had no bottled water when we arrived despite it being 6pm Maintenance of bathroom a bit questionable no hot water in the morning Bathroom shelf loose and sloping so useless to put anything on Bar staff didn t seem to be on the ball when we arrived for a party of kebersihan6 people at 6 keamanankenyamanan despite having prior confirmation from the hotel I had to carry kebersihan6 glasses to our table and open our own champagne no great hardship I appreciate but no what I would have expected ;kerapihan;1
 Sadly checkout problems where the room had been paid for in advance but there was no record and it was embarrassing for my guests and myself ;kerapihan;1
 Sadly the pool was cold and the showers were luke warm We were told they had a problem with the boiler ;kerapihan;1
 Service charges added to all drinks even when you stood at the bar and collected them yourself;kerapihan;1
 Service was slow ;kerapihan;1
 Shame you had to pay for the bowing;kerapihan;1
 Shower was not terribly powerful and my wife said the toiletries were a bit masculine I thought they were fine ;kerapihan;1
 Small point but the charging devices by the bed could have been better quality ;kerapihan;1
 Sound insulation between next room could literally hear EVERYTHING going on next door ;kerapihan;1
 Strange I had to put a further kebersihankenyamanankenyamanan down having already paid for the room Absolutely no service on the rooftop bar despite there being kenyamanan waiters ;kerapihan;1
 That I don t live at the hotel ;kerapihan;1
 The bar had a metal clock table which was beautiful but because of drink spillage there was a strong metallic smell which meant we had to move seats The rooftop bar was shut which was a shame The cocktail making was very slow and the same cocktail tasted different each time The manager was excellent at rectifying this however ;kerapihan;1
 The bed was quite short and I am not a tall person Also there was an issue with the air conditioning in that it would not drop below kebersihan7 degrees in our room making it far too hot Other than that the room was fab and service was great The hotel does seem to have constant music playing in communal areas and it can be loud not really necessary at breakfast etc where you might want some quiet time ;kerapihan;1
 The bouncer type of guy who works night during weekend he could have been more welcoming as I was a guest who stayed for kerapihan weeks No smile at all ;kerapihan;1
 The breakfast was ok but my expectations was not met;kerapihan;1
 The check out was a bit messy everyone arriving at the same Some process improvements can be made here ;kerapihan;1
 The curtains in our room didn t shut properly and though we told housekeeping nothing was done We had to get the concierge to botch up a fix at midnight And the breakfast offered isn t really good enough for a hotel of ambition ;kerapihan;1
 The first day the lift to our part of the hotel stopped working It s a long walk in the heat up to keamananrd floor Also it seems a little disorganised with housekeeping and rooftop bar ;kerapihan;1
 The front of house staff member checking me was dealing with me in quite a rude and dismissive way almost like I didn t deserve to be there It was pretentious I also booked it with the pay nothing until check in but I was told that they took a pre authorisation of the amount for the room and required a further kebersihankenyamanankenyamanan for cover Then asked for id for me and my girlfriend when I asked why it was met with another I m better than you response I ve stayed in far nicer hotels that have cost a lot lot more and equally some that have cost a lot less and this was bar far the worst front of house service I have received I stayed at the m by Montcalm Tech hotel last month and that was much better ;kerapihan;1
 The hotel is very new and still lacks some of the decor that would make it feel more lived in I would suggest having a centerpiece in the main hall with more seating to make it more welcoming Restaurant is not running smoothly yet as the restaurant manager and waiters don t seem to know what they are doing The food is great but I would have liked to see more healthy options The spa is lovely and new but still not fully functioning as there is no staff there Surely all the kinks will be worked out with time ;kerapihan;1
 The jobs worth bar attendant who stopped us from access to our bedroom stating it was staff only areas although there were no signs indicating this and the stairs are open for access;kerapihan;1
 The mini bar in the room contained only mineral water That s not a bar ;kerapihan;1
 The only downside was the rooftop bar had been hired out and we could only go on there from kebersihankenyamananpm;kerapihan;1
 The only issue I could possibly have with my visit to the Courthouse would be when I couldn t get any hot water out of the showers in the spar area It wasn t a major problem as I showered in my room ;kerapihan;1
 The only negative was that in our room there was a large orange pink stain on the floor next to our bed which I hate to say looked like vomit The stain looked to have been cleaned but it was definitely still visible so I was really disappointed about this As we were only staying for one night and had been traveling I didn t want to make a fuss to be moved but I did place a towel over the area ;kerapihan;1
 The only negative was waiting to be served on the rooftop bar took way too long so we ended up moving to the downstairs bar Good choice where we ordered at the bar but the drinks took so long to arrive and even then they brought the wrong drinks Que another long wait ;kerapihan;1
 The outisde view of the hotel and the blankets were not that clean ;kerapihan;1
 The personnel at the reception is very friendly and helpful some Concierges however are a bit too obtrusive ;kerapihan;1
 The pictures showed we would have a bath in the room which we didnt We also didn t have any hot water in the shower in the morning The fire alarm also went off accidentally at 7 keamanankenyamananam which was not a nice wake up ;kerapihan;1
 The pool was freezing in the morning Thought the view would be better Big wall blocking half the view ;kerapihan;1
 The pool was out of order however we were able to use the sauna and steam room The coffee sachets weren t updated the second night of stay perhaps a coffee machine would be better ;kerapihan;1
 The pool wasn t working and we booked this hotel because it had a pool The food in the restaurant was not good very bland undercooked and the chicken for the chicken salad taste like charcoal We would eat out next time ;kerapihan;1
 The restaurant staff although were very helpful I do feel a little training is required fruit and porridge delivered at the same time rather than kerapihan separate courses ;kerapihan;1
 The roof top bar closed ;kerapihan;1
 The room could have been cleaner the shelves were very dusty and design of the taps meant that unless you have turned them on you don t see the dirt underneath which clearly the cleaner did not ;kerapihan;1
 The room service menu wasn t fully available;kerapihan;1
 The room was a bit cold it would have been good to have some extra blankets I also couldn t find the hairdryer ;kerapihan;1
 The room was overlooked by a stairwell on the other side of the building so the room lacked privacy ;kerapihan;1
 The service in the bar was very slow as only one person could make cocktails and the bar was half empty A service charge also got added on which I thought was bad considering we were sat at the bar so it wasn t even table service ;kerapihan;1
 The staff are very attentive pleasant and want to be helpful but some of them are just not fully trained or able to understand;kerapihan;1
 The staff didn t seem to match the maturity of the hotel All very inexperienced and at times not very helpful The bar was also quite lifeless and not very welcoming from the entrance hall ;kerapihan;1
 The staff need more training My friends took keamanan hours to check in The bar staff couldn t manage a cocktail if it wasn t on the limited menu The breakfast came to our room kebersihan 5 hrs after we d ordered it and was wrong ;kerapihan;1
 The Staff Too young seemed inexperienced Breakfast was a perfect example of total disorganisation Two girls running around like headless chickens had to ask keamanan times for simple porridge request We stayed here last year and we re hoping that the staff issues had been sorted as the Hotel had just opened Sadly it has not Even the Manager looked young There was a private party on the Saturday night and the residents couldn t get served in the bar we got shoved into a side room and forgotten Ended up going out All in all the place needs a focused Management approach or they re not going to get repeat business Shame ;kerapihan;1
 The staff were overbearing judgemental and went out of their way to say no Everytime we passed the front desk we were stared at and at times it was very uncomfortable Upon arrival we were shown around the hotel by a lovely guy who showed us all the facilities available in particular the roof terrace with beautiful views I asked if I could go up there to take some photos and was told no problem The next day when I asked to go up I was told no I explained I had been told I could and again rather rudely I was told no by a Manager they had let other guests up previously There were more staff than beds and one of them could have taken us up there Might seem a little thing but what is the point of showing me something I then can t use with no explanation It was a very expensive trip and considered a real treat I was a little disappointed we were not treated better particularly as there were only kebersihankenyamanan guests that weekend It really is the service that makes the stay Saying that there were kerapihan staff who were lovely and helped to redeem some of my disappointment The guy at the desk was great with directions and taking the time to let us know where to go The guy on arrival was great and very helpful nothing was an issue he seemed very embarrassed when we were told we could not go on the roof terrace No robes in the room quickly rectified but a small detail that I shouldn t have to ask for Kettle had to be used on the floor as that was the only available plug point kerapihan teabags and kenyamanan mini pots of milk Hate that Again a small detail but for the cost of the room the tea and coffee facilities were reminiscent of a travel lodge I would stay again in the hope the Manager uses all the feedback positively and perhaps some of these issues were teething problems due to opening The building really is beautiful the older part has more atmosphere and charm ;kerapihan;1
 The swimming pool was out of order the weekend we stayed which was one of the reasons we chose the hotel ;kerapihan;1
 The TV in the bathroom could only use one channel remote control not working Very disappointed that the swimming pool was out of action as the temperature was too cold Had read some reviews on this previously but thought the problem would have been solved a bit disappointing ;kerapihan;1
 The water was cold for a brief period but it was quickly rectified ;kerapihan;1
 There is nothing I would change everything was excellent ;kerapihan;1
 There was a leak from the room above into our bathroom but that was fixed quickly ;kerapihan;1
 There was no information pack in my room on breakfast times spa visits etc etc The team at breakfast need much more training I had paid in advance for breakfast but everthing appeared to be to order There was an empty buffet station with a few pre prepared fruit salads and a plate of pastries but no invitation to help myself I asked for hot water and lemon instead of tea or coffee First time round I got a glass of cold water and lemon and next time I got a single cup of hot water with lemon on the side I would have liked a pot of hot water and some lemon slices It also would have been nice to be offered juice I did make it clear when I arrived that I had pre paid for breakfast There were 5 people in for breakfast and three staff I asked for bercher museli and salmon and scrambled eggs They were both delicious but I saw them arrive and sit on the side for several minutes as no one seemed to know who they were for Then they were delivered to me at the same time and by then the eggs were quite cold There was no offer of toast to accompany it Looking at the menu what I ordered would have cost me less if I had ordered them individually The waiter and waitresses were very polite but seemed completely uncomfortable in their domain It was a big disappointment after every other aspect of my stay had been without fault If I stayed again I would not pre pay for breakfast on this experience ;kerapihan;1
 Towels were not changed daily No information book to look through Shame the roof terrace doesn t have heaters ;kerapihan;1
 Unfortunately TV in bathroom and hand held computer did not work but as we were only booked in for kebersihan night it was not an issue We were also asked if our stay was for a special occasion which it was my wife s 6th birthday and was told that something nice could be arranged but nothing was done Just felt that if nothing was going to be arranged then please do not ask the quest that question;kerapihan;1
 Very bad experience booking in swimming pool closed Staff who are very good are let down by whoever owns this hotel No tea bags in room had lost the will to ask for them small things make big differences ;kerapihan;1
 Very poor service no one answered the phone for room service evening or morning room not available until kenyamananpm rude staff double charge for room service very disappointing ;kerapihan;1
 Very slow checkout;kerapihan;1
 Was promised a parking spot they told me they had plenty returned keamanan hours later to be told they where all gone The hotel is slap bang in the middle of shore ditch;kerapihan;1
 Water only just warm enough for a shower in the morning but fine the evening before The music in the bar was awful unless you are Ed Sheeran s number one fan ;kerapihan;1
 We had a family room but only kerapihan glasses kerapihan slippers kerapihan robes although kenyamanan friends checked in but staff were happy to bring more ;kerapihan;1
 We liked but didn t love our steak in the restaurant There are probably better restaurants in Shoreditch but we were feeling lazy If we stayed here again we probably wouldn t eat in the restaurant but thats just our personal taste and not really a criticism of the hotel ;kerapihan;1
 we ordered kebersihan breakfast from the menu this took over half an hour so we gave up in the end the tv had no volume and maintenance were not available sat nite ;kerapihan;1
 We were a group party bar seems a little disorganised but we eventually got there;kerapihan;1
 We were told the roof top bar was open until kebersihankebersihanpm but was shut before kebersihankenyamanan keamanankenyamananpm on a Saturday night The other bar was a shambles the staff couldn t make a Mojito cocktail it took ages to get served and we were charged a lot of money for two cocktails we didn t ask for it seems there was a slight language barrier The room was nice but badly thought out with no plugs where the kettle is No blind on the bathroom window we weren t over looked but personally I would prefer a blind ;kerapihan;1
 When you have a room at the fifth floor facing the roof top terrace you might want to bring earplugs for a good nights sleep;kerapihan;1
 Worst restaurant experience I have had in years Shockingly bad ;kerapihan;1
 kebersihan Cleanliness of basins in the room after service could be improved a bit more to meet a 5 hotel standard kerapihan Cleanliness of washroom at ground floor needs improvement;kerapihan;1
 A basic breakfast should really be included for the price paid The heating should have been turned on before we entered the room ;kerapihan;1
 a bit expensive for the facilities offered ;kerapihan;1
 A mistake was made on my bar bill I thought I had cleared it up on departure only to find that I was emailed the next day asking for payment Perhaps guests should be asked to sign for drinks charged to their rooms to avoid such confusion;kerapihan;1
 air conditioning was a bit noisy;kerapihan;1
 Bar drinks are pricy and the room was too hot The room was West facing and could do with blinds on the window and the air conditioning ineffectual ;kerapihan;1
 Bar was not that busy at kebersihankebersihanpm ;kerapihan;1
 Basement room was not mentioned in room selection Would have selected another;kerapihan;1
 Bathroom was small the shower tiny The room was small and a bit smelly ;kerapihan;1
 Being in the basement in small room;kerapihan;1
 Breakfast area small felt rather odd Disappointed that for that amount of money no free tea and coffee facilities or water in the room very poor ;kerapihan;1
 Breakfast being extra ;kerapihan;1
 Breakfast croissant had to be sent back Noisy door in hallway throughout the night ;kerapihan;1
 Breakfast service was disorganised ;kerapihan;1
 Breakfast was a little odd as there were not the hot options one would normally expect ie bacon sausage etc ;kerapihan;1
 Breakfast you must buy every item separately but although the hotel is not able to offer normal things like sliced cheese and eggs not even boiled Not a proper room for breakfast Service incredible slow Impression that they don t want guest having breakfast there Staff very keen to pay everything right now F e had to pay for full stay one week at arrival plus deposit minibar Was kind of funny situation Not very friendly and not service orientated Seemed to be not good organized ;kerapihan;1
 Cant stay here forever ;kerapihan;1
 Check out is a bit slow and cumbersome I also get there once or twice a month but the staff does not seem to recognize me other hotels are much more attentive to this ;kerapihan;1
 Cold temperature in bathroom;kerapihan;1
 Complicated login procedure for WIFI provide name bogus email password Need to make sure that one does not get a basement room Staff service is often a bit slow check in out etc ;kerapihan;1
 Could do with a gym Bed neither too hard nor too soft lacking in support ;kerapihan;1
 Desk in the room was on the small side and could use coffeemaker in the room But only minor issues ;kerapihan;1
 Didn t like it being a basement room;kerapihan;1
 Difficult to find fault Perhaps tea coffee in the room would be nice but minor element as lovely coffee can be delivered to the room without a tray charge ;kerapihan;1
 Everything was lovely BUT the staff which made me feel like I was bothering them all the time They would hardly look up when you walk in from street No greetings hardly a salutation and the same thing going out It felt a bit like all the staff was down and unaccessible to clients Hardly any eye contact or human connection which at the end of the day is so cheap but most comforting in a foreign city Small boutique hotel with quirky design but I doubt I d come back due to the unfriendly greetings I also had the terrible surprise that there was no shower tray in the bathroom just a simple shower curtain in one corner of bathroom Awful ;kerapihan;1
 Everything was marvelous except no warm food;kerapihan;1
 Fo9r kebersihan5kerapihan a night disappointed not to be able to make a coffee in the morning had to pay for one by calling room service Mini bar was incredibly expensive ;kerapihan;1
 Free bottled water would have been nice from a 5 star hotel and also tea making facilities that you didnt have to pay for ;kerapihan;1
 Furnishing in the room wasn t as I expected ;kerapihan;1
 Horrible basement rooms cheep impersonal design random staff that didn t seem to know what they were doing ;kerapihan;1
 Housekeeping were a little noisy in the mornings ;kerapihan;1
 I couldn t turn off the air conditioner The natural temp was mild and I would have preferred no AC I did not like my initial room below ground no view but the staff were happy to change my room when I asked ;kerapihan;1
 I did wish I could have made a cup of tea in my room instead of having to order room service or go downstairs to the cosy tastefully designed bar area ;kerapihan;1
 I found the staff seemed badly trained Unable to deal with the simplest request Booked the hotel for keamanan nights and every breakfast was a nightmare The first day it took nearly kenyamanankenyamanan min to be served and the waiter kept on making mistakes on my order Another think I didn t like is the reception area and restaurant They are so small it feels like a waiting room The aisle to the rooms is very narrow ;kerapihan;1
 I have nothing to fault other than that the room is somewhat expensive but even that can be justified ;kerapihan;1
 I like everything about the Laslett no negatives;kerapihan;1
 just tea and coffee in the rooms please ;kerapihan;1
 Kettle in the room would have made it a perfect stay ;kerapihan;1
 lack of restaurant;kerapihan;1
 London tube problems Not the hotels fault ;kerapihan;1
 Missed little goodie like free water in my room Room was quite light at night good investment would be proper blinds ;kerapihan;1
 Next time we will get a bigger room we reserved a double Spare bed for our son took up most of the walking space in room ;kerapihan;1
 No armchair or tea or coffee making facilities in room You could have drink in room service but there was a keamanan tray charge Room was in basement still lovely but view was a brick wall which was disappointing for the price paid ;kerapihan;1
 No floor heating in the bathroom Small breakfast selection ;kerapihan;1
 No full length mirror Surprised that the TV didn t show sky programs;kerapihan;1
 No heating in the bathroom No bathtub only showen Only rooms on kebersihan no view;kerapihan;1
 No iron and ironing board in room however they were provided within kebersihankenyamanan minutes of asking reception for them ;kerapihan;1
 no luggage rack for the room;kerapihan;1
 No parking which is understandable given the location but I feel you should offer free parking for customers at the recommended NCP down the road Also everyone loves a little freebie from a hotel mini toiletries spoils the fun to sell the same products at reception I don t go to a hotel to shop ;kerapihan;1
 No pool and gym ;kerapihan;1
 No tea and coffee making facilities in my room ;kerapihan;1
 No tea coffee or kettle in room hate that Slightly overpriced mini bar Breakfast expensive although very nice ;kerapihan;1
 Noise kenyamananam provoked by drunk neighbours;kerapihan;1
 Not a 5 star hotel Reception breakfast area is what you d expect to find in a hostel Breakfast pricing is a little mystifying ;kerapihan;1
 Ny room was situated under ground level Constant footstep noise from the floor up above reception area Guess they have their spartan booking com rooms in the basement and cosy furshnished rooms up on the higher floors Nothing wrong with that but would have liked to have known ;kerapihan;1
 One or two small things in the bedroom needed attention e g radiator couldn t be adjusted ;kerapihan;1
 Only a slightly picky point but would have preferred to be able to make a coffee in the room in a morning instead of ordering Would still give it an kebersihan5 out of kebersihankenyamanan though ;kerapihan;1
 Our shower drain wasn t working well which made the shower overflow a bit but as I said we were offered complementary drinks in apology since the maintenance manager had gone home for the day ;kerapihan;1
 Ourselves and one member of staff didn t realise we had breakfast included who recommended us to have breakfast round the corner at extra cost when we called up the lady played a repeat message to me saying the breakfast wasn t charged to the room up until the point I said forget it it would had been nice to be offered a complimentary breakfast we re not asking to stay there for the night free we just wanted an excuse tocome back But the breakfast hasn t been charged to your room ;kerapihan;1
 Overall stay was excellent ;kerapihan;1
 Polyester sheets and cheap bedding in a hotel of this quality are a big NO The staff could do with more training they are all friendly but it feels disorganised The catering is disappointing;kerapihan;1
 Pretty designless corridors but that s nothing ;kerapihan;1
 Public areas fairly small ;kerapihan;1
 room as pretty small but that seems to be a standard for london ;kerapihan;1
 room not efficiently designed not an ideal layout plan;kerapihan;1
 Room temperature Shower area was small;kerapihan;1
 Room was a little on the small side Similarly the communal spaces lobby reception library and restaurant area could charitably be described as cosy Small complaint there is only one elevator and it s a bit slow ;kerapihan;1
 room was not really cosy more industrial than I had imagined Furniture in room not great more like a business hotel room no cosi chairs or sofa seat Good for sleeping but not spending time in Also for the price compared to similar hotels in the area wasn t that thrilled;kerapihan;1
 Rooms are very small to what I was expecting I know rooms tend to be smaller in London but not this small My child s buggy won t fit inside so I had to leave it at the concierge Also a bit of an issue with accessibility Blinds not to dark Sun rises at 5 keamanankenyamanan am these days and so did we My toddler was having trouble sleeping because of that You don t want to be up at 5 keamanankenyamanan am on a Sunday ;kerapihan;1
 shower door that prevented water spillage;kerapihan;1
 Shower was terrible design would almost flood bathroom needs to be looked into;kerapihan;1
 slightly limited public areas but not a big deal;kerapihan;1
 some drawer space for clothes would have been useful ;kerapihan;1
 Some Staff were a little offhand and casual during breakfast service and reception lacked some genuine warmth and interest which one hopes for at a boutique hotel in a major city like London Others were superb Room was a little noisy with guests entering and exiting earplugs provided and lacked seating If you have to stay in don t rely on the in house entertainment ;kerapihan;1
 Space allocation for clothes drawers continental breakfast;kerapihan;1
 That we only stayed one night we will make sure to book longer next time;kerapihan;1
 the bathroom size;kerapihan;1
 the bathroom was a bit odd hard to take a shower without getting the floor super wet ;kerapihan;1
 The Bircher muesli the guys need a recipe I can help ;kerapihan;1
 The bottled water I had to purchase in the room was CRAZY expensive and wish they offered at least some purified water in the room but maybe that is asking too much ;kerapihan;1
 The breakfast room only seats about kebersihan6 people It took over kenyamanankenyamanan mins after ordering to receive poached eggs on toast Compared to the quality of everything else in the hotel room the bathrobes were pretty cheap and tired ;kerapihan;1
 The breakfasts are soooooo poor;kerapihan;1
 The constant sound of water running trough pipes directly above the bedhead all night long ;kerapihan;1
 The continental breakfast was tasty but the choice was minimal ;kerapihan;1
 The doors in the hotel are not designed for a hospitality environment The bedroom doors and fire doors are heavy and slam shut With other guests and staff there working the doors are slamming constantly through the night Really terrible for such a new hotel and made for a poor nights sleep The hotel is aesthetically beautiful but there has just not been enough consideration of the functional things that make a 5 star hotel it could be so easily sorted ;kerapihan;1
 The food was basic and overpriced and the restaurant area tiny dark and uncomfortable In the room automatic lights follow you around which is amusing to begin with and then irritating The door rattled so I had to wedge paper in the gap The bathroom fan would not turn off at night and had a persistent hum Heating aircon was difficult to get right Checkout was slow All in all not really worth the price ;kerapihan;1
 The lift can be a bit slow it s a pity there is no parking Bar is lacking in atmosphere but doesn t really matter as lots to do within a short walk or taxi ride;kerapihan;1
 The night team seemed a little less expert Didn t know how to get certain places Also might be good to stock some basic medicines at the front desk And more cups in the rooms ;kerapihan;1
 The Only negative thing i could say is that the cleaning staff is very persistent and would keep on knocking on room ;kerapihan;1
 The play list ;kerapihan;1
 The resteraunt has lots of room for improvement service a little slow BUT food quality poor and overly priced ;kerapihan;1
 The shower was very small in room kebersihan;kerapihan;1
 the size of the room was quite a shock for someone that is used to a spacious hotel room ;kerapihan;1
 The smell of fresh paint ;kerapihan;1
 The staff is disorganized has not idea how a 5 star hotel is Room service bad No coffee maker or tea kettle or iron in the room Sheets are made of polyester A fantastic hotel is all about details and attentive staff that The Laslett is so much in need;kerapihan;1
 The staff was completely hands off and not interested could care less very relax staff;kerapihan;1
 The water in the bath from bath or shower took a very long time to drain away;kerapihan;1
 The weather We had a bit of rain on the Saturday ;kerapihan;1
 There is clearly an ongoing issue with the plumbing ie showers v slow to drain ;kerapihan;1
 There is clearly an ongoing issue with the plumbing in some of the rooms the showers were very slow to drain ;kerapihan;1
 There is no facility to play music in the room other than the TV A bluetooth speaker which can connect to a smartphone would be great ;kerapihan;1
 There s no kettle in the room;kerapihan;1
 There was nothing I disliked about the Laslett It s definitely my kind of place ;kerapihan;1
 There were a number of problems with my room My room was in the basement and there were water pipes from other rooms which made quite a loud noise throughout the night which was disturbing I noticed there were earplugs in the bathroom and see there have been other reviews eg on Tripadvisor complaining about this There was urine in the toilet when I arrived which was disgusting the rest of the room was spotlessly clean I suspect someone had checked in and been moved to another room Although the room did have a window and natural light but it was immediately below the pavement on the street above Not great but main problem was they didn t inform me this would be the case when I booked My room was definitely not 5 star and not worth the high price I paid for it when I politely discussed all the above with the manager in the morning he offered to upgrade me on my next stay but I don t think that was a sufficient response to the above problems ;kerapihan;1
 Very poor room layout and general quality of installation e g Our balcony door was broken and wouldn t close all the way so there was a cold breeze the toilet flush kept sticking towel warmer not working some peeling signage artwork hung unevenly poor soundproofing room layout cramped and illogical made even more so by an unnecessary wall that takes up limited space and separates the bed from the window If there must be a wall it should separate the bed from the door not the other way around Some of this is no doubt corrected in the larger suite rooms Disappointed in the food dinner essentially amounted to pieces of toast have never had bread for dipping in olive oil actually be just pieces of toast and I was surprised that the pastries the next morning were dry and a bit stale especially since they were supposed to be from Sally Clarke who is always unfailingly excellent so it did make me wonder if they were from the day before ;kerapihan;1
 Very pretentious and over rated Some of the staff had a bad attitude Do not stay in room Nkebersihankerapihan it was on the ground floor without much natural light and the grey walks didn t help The check out is at kebersihankebersihan which I think is bad All in all for keamanan5kenyamanan kenyamanankenyamanankenyamanan per night for a standard room you could do a lot better ;kerapihan;1
 We did not sleep well in this hotel The doors are not good very well insulated so you woke up every time an other room slammed the door when leaving They have to change the doors so that you can get a good sleep ;kerapihan;1
 We had a room in the basement so we had no view and there was a very slight damp smell in the bathroom The tap in the bathroom was lose and the shower drained away very slowly We also thought the big bar costs in our room were rather pricy Apart from this absolutely no complaints and I would definitely highly recommend the hotel ;kerapihan;1
 we prefer a breakfast buffet but realise that there is limited space missed tea making facility in room hair dryer difficult to operate ;kerapihan;1
 We would have liked a jug to make tea in the room ;kerapihan;1
 Welcome at the reception was not exactly enthusiastic or warm We were given two rooms in the basement so view consisted of a wall Next to our room was a house keeping office which was busy and noisy ;kerapihan;1
 Well it was a bit Ikea ish in terms of decor and furniture there was no full length mirror which is bad dark as you are in almost a basement Also there is nothing free in room mainly water you would expect a bottle but no all had to be paid for which we thought was poor Shower gels etc are Neals Yard but non to take away ;kerapihan;1
 Why can t I get that kebersihankerapihan5 rate every day ;kerapihan;1
 WLAN system is a bit complicated compared to most other hotels Several screeens to go through to get access and need to provide email address although fake email address works fine ;kerapihan;1
 Wonderful team beautiful hotel love it so much;kerapihan;1
 Would have liked tea or coffee making things in the room but other than that our stay was faultless ;kerapihan;1
 Would have liked to have tea and coffee facilities in the room;kerapihan;1
 Wrong billing including items I did not use from mini bar;kerapihan;1
 kebersihan Breakfast is very symbolic i e nothing to eat at all and fit only for a dire keamanan vegetarian diet though elegantly arranged kerapihan VERY limited space to arrange your garment in the room and no good place to storage your luggage i e your feel like on a provincial railway station relates to deluxe king room keamanan Though booked over a month in advance on a cancellation tariff i e no deposits presumed the story is this keamanan kebersihan Deposit was immediately preauthorised and in USD on a Euro card keamanan kerapihan I already left the hotel and fully paid for stay in cash but Euro kerapihankenyamanankenyamanan of pre auth in still there and the hotel people insist it is a problem with MY BANK which ALWAYS releases money in MAX keamanan minutes after cancellation operation and confirms it by SMS Guess if you want to credit the hotel for couple of months your help would not even be confirmed and thanked for ;kerapihan;1
 kebersihan There s construction going on on the opposite side of the hotel but we didn t experience any noise problem during our stay kerapihan No ventilation in either the toilet or bathroom keamanan The AC was a bit warm I didn t want to open the windows as the street noise may disturb our sleep kenyamanan The pillows were my biggest complaint They were way too flat and fluffy to my liking 5 Very flimsy door card signage It kept flying away whenever we open close the doors 6 Most of the interesting channels were not available in English language ;kerapihan;1
 A very small thing shower in a bath but this is not unusual in European Hotels ;kerapihan;1
 AC could be left on longer into October although this year the weather did turn cooler and was not a problem This would have been a problem had it been warmer Windows do need to be shut at night because of street noise ;kerapihan;1
 Across the hotel Something is being built A lot of noise coming from the working place So the hotel cant do anything about it offcourse it really put an end to a good sleep ;kerapihan;1
 Advertised WIFI did not work most of the time Whether you were in your room or downstairs in the lobby it rarely worked Not good when you need it for reservations bookings etc Staff was not helpful with resolving the issue ;kerapihan;1
 Although the bed was a double bed the mattress on top was kerapihan singles which made sleeping on the bed slightly uncomfortable;kerapihan;1
 As mentioned on the website there was some noise from the building work across the way but as this was a city break and we were not in our room much this did not really affect us ;kerapihan;1
 Asked for twin room to share with sister it was quite small for the cost of it ;kerapihan;1
 At best this hotel is a keamanan 5 star There is construction directly facing most of the rooms The more elevated the room the better but the bystanders that attend what appears to be a bar facing the hotel generates additional noise And the ear plugs provided just don t cut it ;kerapihan;1
 At the moment there is construction work across the street from the hotel May disturb those who want to sleep late ;kerapihan;1
 Average food that I thought was grossly overpriced The drinks were extortionate Minibar also very overpriced;kerapihan;1
 Bad wifi in room we reported it but it wasn t sorted out Bar fridge in room wasn t replenished daily as promised ;kerapihan;1
 bath rooms are not upto standards for kenyamanan star hotel;kerapihan;1
 Bathroom configuration lacked proper privacy Roof top staff keen to move us on at night so they could get it ready for the morning which we resisted ;kerapihan;1
 Bathroom rather small but not a major problem ;kerapihan;1
 bed is very soft personally would have preferred a firmer bed;kerapihan;1
 Bed was no comfortable value for money room service;kerapihan;1
 Before booking we were not made aware of extensive building work including mechanical diggers opposite from 6am Terrible duvets for bed only singles even if you get a double twin Rooms are tired and need refreshing ;kerapihan;1
 Bench for large luggage was a bit small ;kerapihan;1
 Better more pillows Staff at check in was not very helpful or friendly when we arrived ;kerapihan;1
 Billows are so soft ;kerapihan;1
 Breakfast basic but we re used to room only so a bonus ;kerapihan;1
 Breakfast should have been included in price;kerapihan;1
 Breakfast was expensive for what it was Pancakes cold and fruit mouldy;kerapihan;1
 Breakfast was not up to five star hotel standard very unhappy about the sky bar the day we arrived went for pre dinner drinks unable to get a seat as other guests were using all the main bar seating area for sunbathing Went back later for night cap the bar haven t been tidied up with rubbish and towels lying all over the place the young bar staff appear to have no control on stopping guests hogging bar seating area for hours on end other thing that really annoyed me was the 7kenyamanan euro charge to use the steam room and sauna for kenyamanan5 minutes ;kerapihan;1
 Breakfast wasn t included and price was kerapihankenyamanan euros which was a little too expensive in my opinion;kerapihan;1
 Building work opposite the hotel starts at 7am so no sleeping past that time However the hotel is very apologetic and offers all drinks at half price ;kerapihan;1
 Can t find any fault;kerapihan;1
 Cannot complain about any thing ;kerapihan;1
 Cleaning could have been better Construction site at the opposite side of the road They fortunatelly didn t have any work going on during the weekend;kerapihan;1
 cleaning lady once came too early building site in front of the hotel dirty street somewhat shabby for the price and four stars spooky lift electric kettle with a broken rim furniture ;kerapihan;1
 Construction across the road not the hotels fault but there was a little noise in our room facing the construction side upon check in we were told if it was too noisy we could move but it was mostly in the morning when we were getting up anyway so it wasn t an issue There isn t anything much to dislike the only thing i wasn t a fan of is you have to ask for coffee at breakfast it isn t self serve but it isn t a big deal I would stay here again if i went back to Vienna ;kerapihan;1
 Construction work outside was very noisy;kerapihan;1
 Continuous difficulty with Internet even though staff did their best to help ;kerapihan;1
 Cooked breakfast buffet was lukewarm Silly cost of cocktails;kerapihan;1
 Could have been able to arrange better taxi rate back to airport Friends who booked the same taxi that brought them they got nearly half price return ;kerapihan;1
 Difficult to find any negatives Would have liked a roof top bar terrace for those relaxing afternoon drinks ;kerapihan;1
 difficult to find the private parking;kerapihan;1
 Dim lighting in rooms is atmospheric but can make it difficult to see Overdoes the moody dark grey theme ;kerapihan;1
 Double bed with single edredon didn t work;kerapihan;1
 During check in and check out nobody from the staff was smiling ;kerapihan;1
 Elevators out of order issues;kerapihan;1
 Erm ;kerapihan;1
 expensive parking on different place undeground garage ;kerapihan;1
 Extremely pricy breakfast You ll find better breakfast deals around the hotel ;kerapihan;1
 Extremely small room too small for the price Not great value ;kerapihan;1
 First day wifi was a catastrophe But after spoken to the reception it worked ;kerapihan;1
 First off when we arrived in the room the extra bed for our kebersihankeamananyr old was in the corridor in the room but you had to walk like a crab to edge round it It was moved later that day to beside our bed but really there wasn t space then between the beds and the desk to make coffee We made the best of it Only a few nights there and the hotel was full I checked or I would have paid for upgrade ;kerapihan;1
 First they gave us the room of smaller size and facilities than we booked and payed for and tried to explain that everything is OK Finally the next day they agreed that we were right and we moved to another room I advise to double check what room you booked and what you get ;kerapihan;1
 Foam pillows ;kerapihan;1
 Food and drink is bit pricy;kerapihan;1
 Found breakfast room too busy even though we paid for breakfast we ended up eating out to avoid long wait ;kerapihan;1
 Free mini bar was not restocked once throughout our 5 night stay ;kerapihan;1
 Front bedrooms very noisy had to be moved;kerapihan;1
 Getting into the hotel was a challenge as there is no street access and we were driving We had to stop in the street with flashers on to get the car unloaded and get directions to the parking structure Dinner at the hotel was very pricey for what was offered Also our rooms were facing the main street and it was noisy until the wee hours ;kerapihan;1
 Glass door in the toilet poor sound isolation in the toilet;kerapihan;1
 Glass partition in toilet not suitable for people sharing;kerapihan;1
 Had to wait over an hour and a half as our room wasn t ready Coffee machine was broken in the room although they replaced it instantly when we told them ;kerapihan;1
 Hotel decor is very dark in passageways and housekeeping was a bit unreliable Also like all city hotels it was very noisy ;kerapihan;1
 Hotel is great but expensive Lighting in the hotel is weak in the rooms in the corridors and in the lobby this need to be improved ;kerapihan;1
 Hotel room was average at best Cleanliness was average for a five star property ;kerapihan;1
 I asked for a double room The room had a double bed but a single duvet which I found odd however the bed was very comfortable The room was quite warm however when a staff member came to sort my padlock he turned on my air con and it was sorted Another very minor issue was no iron and ironing board in the room but was available on request ;kerapihan;1
 I cannot think of any;kerapihan;1
 I cannot think of anything that could be better ;kerapihan;1
 I could hear person walking around in the room above unfortunately that was at 5am ;kerapihan;1
 I had trouble with the Wifi ;kerapihan;1
 I have been to this hotel kenyamanan 5 times it is on the pricey side for a room;kerapihan;1
 I needed to remind things that usually go without saying like changing linen every three days ;kerapihan;1
 I thought that the breakfast could use some improvements and have a bigger variety But all in all it was ok ;kerapihan;1
 I was concerned about building work opposite;kerapihan;1
 I wasn t keen on the works going on around the place But they won t be there long ;kerapihan;1
 I wished they offered Breakfast on the roof terrace ;kerapihan;1
 I would have love to have a little more light in the room ;kerapihan;1
 I would only mark the hotel down slightly on value for money as it was quite a high price per night but that is the way of things in Vienna I guess ;kerapihan;1
 If you travel arround by foot it s a bit away from turist places but they are easiely rechable by near by metro station ;kerapihan;1
 Iffy wifi ;kerapihan;1
 In the room we were staying every morning around 8 kenyamanankenyamanan we could here water being flushed through some of the piping in the wall this did not bother me as I slept right through it but for my mother it s was harder to sleep ;kerapihan;1
 Internet service was utterly unreliable ;kerapihan;1
 It didn t have a restaurant but still plenty of restaurants nearby ;kerapihan;1
 It is a little noisy it s a busy place but the rooms carry noise through a bit ;kerapihan;1
 It s in the middle of construction or maybe it s due to the construction across the street but the sign to the hotel was hard to see ;kerapihan;1
 It was a bit noisy due to construction work going on However in general no other comments ;kerapihan;1
 It was quite noisy in the hotel;kerapihan;1
 It wasn t the cheapest but it was worth it you get what you pay for;kerapihan;1
 Items in refrigerator were never replaced except for water ;kerapihan;1
 Just we had the hard time finding the place but we found it finally ;kerapihan;1
 Lack of bedside tables No bathroom doorry dark room Va;kerapihan;1
 Lack of sunbeds on terrace Unreliable towel supply on pool terrace No duvet on bed Concierge lack of knowledge Coffee at breakfast luke warm Dirty plastic glasses at terrace bar;kerapihan;1
 Lady on the recepcion;kerapihan;1
 Lift slow and small Could be a problem for some ;kerapihan;1
 Lift was very slow and too small for the number of rooms towels were hard and not very absorbent;kerapihan;1
 Lighting in the room made it a bit hard to read at night ;kerapihan;1
 little noisy due to construction accrues the street;kerapihan;1
 Location friendly staff cleanliness n comfortable room ;kerapihan;1
 Lovely champagne buffet breakfast however on some occasions the food was cold cool and would have been much tastier if warm i e the fried scrambled eggs the pancakes the croissants View from the room wasn t the best Overlooked a children s play area however this did not effect our stay Wifi connection in the room was intermittent ;kerapihan;1
 Lovely room but the noise from lift forced us to wear ear plugs No problem as room was top notch;kerapihan;1
 Main lobby lighting must sparkle and invite Clients;kerapihan;1
 Major problem with the noise from the building site across the road starting before 6 keamanankenyamanan in the morning Hotel staff were very apologetic and gave us free drinks but it s outside their control a real shame At least Saturday and Sunday mornings were quiet ;kerapihan;1
 Major repair works are taking place in front of the hotel and might last for quite long time Unfortunately the staff gave me a room at the first floor facing the entrance to the repair area Very noisy works started at 5 kenyamanankenyamananam The earplugs offered by the hotel were clearly not enough to ensure a good sleep The WiFi in my room was very slow and required a login each time I tried to access the web ;kerapihan;1
 Mess up by booking com having two reservations;kerapihan;1
 my directions ;kerapihan;1
 My friends gave me a gift massage for my birthday and the hotel delivered the invoice with the cost and only later delivered the actual gift certificate That should not have happened ;kerapihan;1
 Nast rude female staff;kerapihan;1
 Next door building site was really a pain i but the staff made aware of this and consequently I accepted this as just another experience which will dissappear before i come next time ;kerapihan;1
 No Bar meals in the hotel only snacks therefore we had to go out to eat every day even though it was very heavy rain Seating in room;kerapihan;1
 No concierge to pick our luggage;kerapihan;1
 No full length mirror in my room which was annoying room kerapihankebersihan6 and on kerapihannd night very noisy drunk next door guests not the hotels fault and the staff were very apologetic and acted quickly and moved me to another room upgrade so problem sorted;kerapihan;1
 no issue at all well done guys ;kerapihan;1
 No negatives during stay ;kerapihan;1
 No on site parking even with discount rate at local car park which is good the price is still expensive No gym spa facilities on site;kerapihan;1
 No separate shower;kerapihan;1
 No shuttle bus to or from airport;kerapihan;1
 No sound insulation You hear all your neighbours snoring Executive rooms are tiny The pictures do not represent the reality The toilet and the bedroom are in the same space You partner hears how you go on toilet Horrible Lifts smell like someone has died in them No privacy Housekeeping comes keamanan times a day starting from 9am to wake you up and even if you hang do not disturb sign they knock on neighbours door and you hear everything because there is no sound insulation Then they start banging the floor of the neighbour with vacum cleaner so forget getting any sleep in the morning the key card was getting reset everyday So every time you have to go to reception and ask for new one No toilet brush Internet only keamanan devices per room ;kerapihan;1
 No view from window but view from pool on top floor excellent;kerapihan;1
 noise from renovation next door;kerapihan;1
 Noise from the contruction site across the street ;kerapihan;1
 Noisey hotel bedroom;kerapihan;1
 Noisy at night because of the skybar Small rooms with no view ;kerapihan;1
 Noisy from main road and metro despite being upgraded Room not cleaned from kebersihankenyamanan to kenyamanan whilst we we were out No hot water last day ;kerapihan;1
 not a lot wrong with this place for me you could argue the area around the bed is a tad tight in my room but didn t bother me However there is no restaurant breakfast only but plenty of near by places to visit ;kerapihan;1
 Not much really A bit mean with tea and coffee supplies in the room but delivered promptly when we asked Maybe the cocktail menu could be a bit more extensive Bathrobes were thin small ;kerapihan;1
 Nothing at all everything was perfect and awesome;kerapihan;1
 Nothing could have improved our stay at the Grand Hotel Central except an additional night for free ;kerapihan;1
 nothing much to complain about;kerapihan;1
 Nothing negative to say about this hotel we had a verypositive experience ;kerapihan;1
 Nothing really although the location is a little noises but that s to be expected in city centre location ;kerapihan;1
 Nothing really other than the door to the bathroom was a little rickety ;kerapihan;1
 Nothing the place is amazing ;kerapihan;1
 Nothing to say was simply fantastic ;kerapihan;1
 On the 8 floor room air condition not working properly a little bit airless ;kerapihan;1
 One of the check in staff was very rude to me I did not deal with him again ;kerapihan;1
 One of the elevators to the left of the entrance handles only kebersihan5kenyamanan kilos ;kerapihan;1
 One of the guys at reception looked at me like I didn t belong there because I m young and had a skateboard in my hand;kerapihan;1
 Only downside was being on the first floor meant lots of pipe noise from showers and toilets on higher floor Hard to change in an older building but Barcelona is a late night city so it s noise all night ;kerapihan;1
 Only issue was with quality of the cocktails on one of the nights that we stayed But that was just a minor bump in an otherwise excellent stay ;kerapihan;1
 Only problem was that there was construction across the street but somehow it never disturbed me maybe because I needed to get up early every day anyways Also the room structure was a bit weird ;kerapihan;1
 Only slight niggle was the shower gel dispenser not being replaced but really not a big deal at all ;kerapihan;1
 Our room had a weird smell ;kerapihan;1
 Outside noise one evening only;kerapihan;1
 Over kenyamanan full days the wifi has never worked properly with n kerapihan different laptops intermittent and unstable connection awfully slow definitely unusable For job purposes I ended up with using my cellphone in hot spot mode and roaming Complaints raised did not lead to any problem solution A hotel like this would deserve a better attention to this ;kerapihan;1
 Parking is a bit far from the hotel and you have to go and park your car yourself The suite we got upgraded to had some issues with the electrical installation we informed the staff I hope they have managed to fix it ;kerapihan;1
 Parking spot was a bit pricey ;kerapihan;1
 Parking was not onsite and a little distance from the hotel Not a major problem but you could at least drop off passengers and luggage in front of the hotel ;kerapihan;1
 Perhaps the bar service could have been better but I m just being picky ;kerapihan;1
 Pillows and bed Room service has no food only limited snacks Elevator s small space ;kerapihan;1
 Pillows not very comfortable It s a matter of tastes of course Offering firmer ones as an option would increase appeal ;kerapihan;1
 Plastic wine glasses at pool bar not cleaned properly lipstick and fingerprints from previous user Obviously had not been washed properly For such a nice area you need to find better shatter proof glasses The ones you are using are basic picnic glasses which were very poor quality and difficult to keep clean and look scratched and dirty ;kerapihan;1
 Pool bar menu no good drinks take kebersihan5 minutes to come;kerapihan;1
 pool could have been warmer ;kerapihan;1
 Pool was packed so packed that there were no seats anywhere Asked how it was so packed and they indicated non hotel guests were using the pool We tried keamanan kenyamanan different times to use it with the same results No seats so we left We waited for a while just standing to get a drink with no luck Staff there was swamped We did get to use it the last day and it was wonderful The views drinks and food Disappointed though that we got ready to swim and relax multiple times and had to come back to the rooms immediately ;kerapihan;1
 pool was very crowded no room to sit down;kerapihan;1
 Prices at the pool bar and the pool was too cold;kerapihan;1
 Pricey room service;kerapihan;1
 PROBLEM WITH ROOM NOISE FROM WATER DRIPPING BUT WAS RESOLVED QUICKLY;kerapihan;1
 Problem with Wifi for phones but there may be nothing that can be done about it ;kerapihan;1
 Quite pricey car park tiny windows in room no keamanankeamanan8 broken sweat room ;kerapihan;1
 Relatively expensive The music in the pool bar ;kerapihan;1
 restaurant food;kerapihan;1
 Roof top view not as advertised but ok ;kerapihan;1
 Room is small restaurant is also very small;kerapihan;1
 Room quite small for the amount we paid ;kerapihan;1
 Room rather dark due to limited light as central with buildings opposite Great being so central ;kerapihan;1
 Room slightly minimalist;kerapihan;1
 Room temperature high kerapihan5C airco not working lot of noise outside late in the evening ;kerapihan;1
 Room was a bit small We don t like open plan glass fronted bathrooms ;kerapihan;1
 Room was a bit smaller than I had expected and there was only one window so it could be a bit dingey even in the day The bathroom was not fully seperated and you could see the toilet from the bed even when the door was shut which was strange Although our room was non smoking there was a strong smoke smell occasionally I think coming through ventilation When we went there was works going on throughout the hotel and the skybar was closed which was disapointing ;kerapihan;1
 room was a bit too small mainly due to the huge king size bed put in the middle room and bathroom are separated by a sliding door which does not totally insulate the two rooms;kerapihan;1
 Room was a little small and noisy housekeeping kept their trolley outside the room so we were woken a few times by their chatter in the mornings ;kerapihan;1
 Room was so dark and reception a bit dark as well;kerapihan;1
 Room was too small to feel relaxed there metal bed frame took away from an otherwise luxurious 5 star feeing;kerapihan;1
 Rooms are small but nice The street Tiefer Graben is a bit dull and less exiting which you forget just by walking 5 minutes ;kerapihan;1
 Rooms were hot and AC didn t seem to work There is a building site opposite and nightclub not far away so it can be loud at night ;kerapihan;1
 Sauna has to be booked for an extra charge 5kenyamanan euros p h ;kerapihan;1
 Separate toilet and bathroom in room ;kerapihan;1
 Service in bar restaurant a little slow;kerapihan;1
 Shower in the room just ok nicer version of the typical European hotel shower Everything in the bathroom was updated and adequate but other hotels we have stayed at in different cities at the same price range had nicer bathrooms Rooftop bar is only open until 9pm during the winter months;kerapihan;1
 Single duvets;kerapihan;1
 Slow Bar service Only a very minor item ;kerapihan;1
 Smell in the room 77kerapihan due to the leackage from Aircondition No compliments for caused inconveniences We complained ones Housekeeper just put towel on the floor howeve smell oixisted the whole stay This is unacceptable Internet is very poor in our room ;kerapihan;1
 So many kids there which surprised me for the style of hotel it is Very luxurious and classy and ruined by many kids charging around and bombing in the pool Nothing worst then relaxing and sunbathing to be getting wet every time a kid dives into the pool I ve got no problem with kids just felt like either the staff or there parents should have more control over them ;kerapihan;1
 som noise frome the street;kerapihan;1
 Some building work going on opposite hotel but the noise was minimal and unobtrusive ;kerapihan;1
 Some music at the rooftop bar would have been nice ;kerapihan;1
 Some reception staff could have been a little more helpful ;kerapihan;1
 Sorry couldn t fault it ;kerapihan;1
 Sound proofing between rooms isn t great ;kerapihan;1
 Spa washed to use and not readily accessible due to needing to contact reception to use ;kerapihan;1
 staff in the Restaurant and the bar not always attentive we waited for more than kerapihan5 minutes in the City Bar for the order also the staff during our dinner was not really fast attentive Rooms are not very big;kerapihan;1
 Standard executive room keamanankerapihankebersihan a bit small ;kerapihan;1
 Steam room or sauna actually costs an additional SEVENTY EUROS per bath Plus requires booking in advance Unbelievable Swimming pool seems to be home to a number pigeons and sea gulls who like to drink from and bathe in the water If you don t mind the wildlife the views are actually very good Rooms are good but very small Have had more spacious rooms in even kerapihan star hotels Some of the mini bar costs are enough to make even regular 5 star hotel guests spit out their coffee Save yourself 5 for a tiny bottle of still water and get about kebersihankenyamanan litres of the stuff literally across the road ;kerapihan;1
 Stuff could have been nicer;kerapihan;1
 Temporary weekday noise from building work nearby starts early in the morning before 7am ;kerapihan;1
 That one or two things went wrong during our visit and despite a request to speak to the Hotel Manager not contact was made the reception staff were great though but the lack of leadership was not The service in the pool area wasn t great;kerapihan;1
 That we couldn t have stayed longer ;kerapihan;1
 The bar in the hotel was very small with no atmosphere;kerapihan;1
 The bar in the hotel while offering 5kenyamanan off drinks because of the building work opposite could not manage a whiskey with ginger ale and when we asked for Gin and Tonic the bar man took out bitter lemon not tonic However we learned later that he was a new member of staff It would be nice to have a lounge to sit in that is not the main reception area ;kerapihan;1
 The bar ran out of Gin ;kerapihan;1
 The breakfast is not good should be rich with many varieties;kerapihan;1
 The breakfast spread was poor Not much options for muslims or even vegetarian Room have no air conditioning When we were there the temperature raises up to kerapihan5C Have to open window but not comfortable because facing apartments and hotel across the road The elevator is ridiculously small Can t even accommodate two people and two bags ;kerapihan;1
 The Breakfast unfortunately the breakfast was a little weak in selection It would benefit greatly by having a cooked selection on offer regarding how you want your eggs etc Also in a hotel such as this I would have expected fresh salmon to be on the buffet and or more local produce such as found in the Market at Los Rambolas ;kerapihan;1
 The cleanliness of the room was ok but one day replacing of our dirty towels did not take place Maybe it might have been a mistake;kerapihan;1
 The decor is a little dark ;kerapihan;1
 The deluxe King room has a nice city view but the noise from the street is something which cannot be ignored despite the double sealed window On top of that the window cannot be opened luckily we brought with us ear plugs so we slept just fine ;kerapihan;1
 The deluxe king room offers a basic comfort and without a good separation with the bathroom area The room although on the seventh floor was a bit noisy from the street Generally it seems to not be in a 5 stars hotel ;kerapihan;1
 The elevator in the new part was a little small and hard to get luggage into ;kerapihan;1
 The facilitis are limited no restaurants and room services ;kerapihan;1
 The food menus could possibly of also catered for people who aren t as adventurous with their food ;kerapihan;1
 The food quality in the roof top bar ;kerapihan;1
 The front desk forgot to give us a wake up call which thru our schedule off considerably ;kerapihan;1
 The hair dryer didn t work properly ;kerapihan;1
 The hotel has a different types of rooms but the way the same type can look is still different it s like you are in another hotel Because it s has a two buildings conected inside the quality of materials and interior details are not the same The main building whith reception is the better one Or it could be that I wasn t lucky ;kerapihan;1
 The hotel has a small bar but does not have a restaurant;kerapihan;1
 The individual duvets I was not surprised because I had seen this in previews reviews But really single duvets in a double bed Not a good choice and went against comfort even though the bed itself was good The welcome could have been more enthusiastic The taxi to the airport while it s not the hotel s fault the driver did not seem familiar with the bus station and was not able to communicate in English not a flaw in itself but necessary for what we needed to accomplish resulting in him leaving me past the station entrance where I could not see it and telling me that he did not know where I should go I was about kebersihankenyamanan meters from the entrance but the moment was very stressful until I discovered that as no one in the street was able to help either It would be helpful if when calling a taxi the hotel could ensure that either the driver can communicate with the passenger or knows where the tourist needs to go for his travel They changed to nicer thicker round soap on the last day of my stay the previous super thin tablets were inconvenient ;kerapihan;1
 The king bed was actually two twins connected No proper blanket Housekeeping moving the stuff which they are not supposed to You can feel cost saving everyday something missed towel or chocolate or tea ;kerapihan;1
 The lobby was not very welcoming a little dark and cramped ;kerapihan;1
 The madras was a bit sunken ;kerapihan;1
 The offer if the room is with or without breakfast should be much more visible ;kerapihan;1
 The only negative is that there is no restaurant in the evening ;kerapihan;1
 The only thing is a film or drama channel with English subtitles would have been good the only English channels were news channels;kerapihan;1
 The only thing that constantly was nagging us was the actions of the staff during breakfast They missed the order quite often i e bringing black tea or even coffee instead of ordered green bringing hard boiled instead of soft boiled eggs bringing two eggs on several occasions even though we explicitly ordered one etc Not a big deal especially that otherwise the selection of food was excellent ;kerapihan;1
 The only thing that could have been better was there wasn t any storage for toiletries in the bathroom It is a gorgeous modern look but not very functional However very easy to overlook given how incredible the room as a whole was ;kerapihan;1
 The only thing we really didn t like was that one day staff was smoking in the rooftop pantry kitchen and that a chef was seen picking sliced fruit from containers and putting it in his mouth with his bare hands and licking fingers Despite the fact that the roof wasn t open to just everyone from the street it did get a bit crowded up there and we feel personnel should help a bit more to keep people from hogging the beds and the sofa s with towels while not actually using them for sometimes an hour or longer on end We had to wait and couldn t sit to eat and drink while others had left their towels to reserve a space I guess the waiters were just too nice to remove them ;kerapihan;1
 The pillows were not good we would suggest them to offer a pillow program we have seen that in many hotels before and that was an advantage ;kerapihan;1
 the pool deck was always a little crowded and the cost of the drinks were a pretty high for Barcelona;kerapihan;1
 The pool was crowded with lots of little children ;kerapihan;1
 The price fore food water and coffee was to high I live at better hotels whit lover prices 5 EURO for kenyamanan keamanankeamanan Cl of water is to high Get a grip Hotel central Barcelona ;kerapihan;1
 The rain However the weather was pretty good Loved Vienna so no complaints;kerapihan;1
 The rate is not fair;kerapihan;1
 the room is very hot in April I couldn t sleep because the cooling system not working in winter only heating also we open the window but it was noisy till keamanan am too much people talking and laughing I think there NightClub down street We couldn t sleep in the hotel I highly not recommend it ;kerapihan;1
 The room overall was a bit small Although the bed was large it sort of filled most of the room The bathroom had glass doors so no real privacy when you went to the toilet ;kerapihan;1
 The room was a bit warm at times Aircon couldn t be regulated Needed to open windows sometimes ;kerapihan;1
 The room was dark and smaller than it seemed in the photos Overall the hotel was very dark The pool was cold and had no shallow end for our kids to swim in Also I booked an extra night by accident and was refused a refund ;kerapihan;1
 The room was extremely small air conditioning was very poor a technician simply switched it off and opened the window As a result I enjoyed mosquitoes couldn t sleep well When tried to use the electric tea kettle the light in the whole room turned off Luckily the phone worked I managed to call the reception ;kerapihan;1
 The room was not being cleaned according to our expectations The cups were not washed and left in the sink and the next day we were given a broken cup ;kerapihan;1
 The room was SO dark Ladies if you put on make up this is the wrong place for you Modern clean but DARK In the lobby I heard other guests talking about how dark their rooms were Oddly outside of our window was a light single light bulb which was on and very bright till around keamanan in the morning Shone into our faces hard to sleep Could not be turned off We could have pulled down the roller but I can t sleep in pitch dark room I need a little bit of the blinds open I had asked to be away from elevators and they gave me a room right next to the employee elevators which was extremely noisy ;kerapihan;1
 The room was too dark with small windows Also the price was a little stiff but I think the location is the main reason ;kerapihan;1
 The rooms ar not on the same level as the public areas in the hotel;kerapihan;1
 The rooms are very basic and small but clean;kerapihan;1
 The rooms we are little too dark and the walls outside the rooms were dark grey which gave me a little depressed feeling ;kerapihan;1
 The service at the pool bar could be slow I would also recommend a more organized check out area as the wait was too long ;kerapihan;1
 The service in the Skybar was extremely slow views excellent pool not heated;kerapihan;1
 The service is so unprogessional ;kerapihan;1
 The shower leaked The cleaner didn t remove a dirty glass from our room ;kerapihan;1
 the Skybar was very very disappointing the view is beautiful however it felt as if the staff were unwilling to work incompetent and it s sad to have such a unique spot and not doing your best to give the best experience possible ;kerapihan;1
 The small and very fine duvets and bed being two beds pushed together;kerapihan;1
 The staff at breakfast were rude and made me feel like I was imposing because of this I chose to eat breakfast out each day which worked out cheaper;kerapihan;1
 The staff at the rooftop bar needed a bit more training They always seemed to be taking orders to the wrong tables and missing parts of orders ;kerapihan;1
 The street the hotel is in is a bit scruffy not helped by current building works opposite major development however noise from site only apparent 7am kenyamananpm weekdays and not at all on weekends Most guests would be out sightseeing in the day so of no consequence Hotel compensates with 5kenyamanan discount on bar bill If you are the kind of guest who prefers to loiter in the hotel during the day or to use for a business meeting this would not be suitable;kerapihan;1
 The tax not being added to my he total;kerapihan;1
 The very busy street it s on and the shower in a bath also but noisy in bedroom;kerapihan;1
 The views from our room we were facing the back and not the main road ;kerapihan;1
 The washroom door did not fully close and not enough light in the room ;kerapihan;1
 The Wi Fi in suite kebersihankenyamanan8 is hopeless if you want to do any work;kerapihan;1
 The wi fi in the rooms isn t great it isn t easy to have conference calls for work on Skype the bathroom needs a better shower curtain room was flooded after a shower The location is very central in one of the more attractive parts of the inner city but the street the hotel is located on is pretty unattractive boring kerapihankenyamanankenyamananm walk to the main road but that isn t the hotel s fault ;kerapihan;1
 The wifi connection isn t very good ;kerapihan;1
 the window in my room did not close fully hence the sounds of Barcelona at night seeped in;kerapihan;1
 There is building works going on across the street but there was no noise before 8am and the hotel compensated by 5kenyamanan off at the bar and also gave kerapihan out of the keamanan days breakfasts for free Did not affect us is any way ;kerapihan;1
 There is construction across the road which started at 6am one morning it was usually 7am and was very loud But the hotel did offer half price drinks at the bar to compensate although it isn t their fault ;kerapihan;1
 There is construction work going on across the road I m an early riser so it had no impact on me but if you want to sleep in then I recommend you look somewhere else because the noise will ruin your morning ;kerapihan;1
 There is major construction across the street starting at 7 AM but the hotel offset that by offering half price drinks on everything in the bar How about a good bottle of Gruner Veltlinger for only kebersihankeamanan euros ;kerapihan;1
 There is no restaurant in the hotel to eat dinner;kerapihan;1
 there s nothing not to like about The Grand Central;kerapihan;1
 There was a construction just in front of the hotel and beside the legislation and all efforts of the hotel team to minimize the noise this was a little bit annoying people revolving rocks at 6 am ;kerapihan;1
 There was absolutely nothing that I didn t like I liked everything And I hope to return ;kerapihan;1
 There was cobwebs behind the cutains in the room;kerapihan;1
 There was construction going on directly across from the hotel during our stay The crews would start work as early as 6am which was an unacceptable time for us ;kerapihan;1
 There were no disappointments ;kerapihan;1
 These are quibbles rather than major issues but Poor design of room and bathroom No full length mirror Lighting in wrong place Window blind arrangement not ideal ;kerapihan;1
 They could serve snacks at the very nice rooftop;kerapihan;1
 They only have kebersihan elevator lift for the entire building Didn t really bother us though We still recommend the hotel and stay here again next time ;kerapihan;1
 Thought we had breakfast included but didn t an extremely expensive hotel so did expect to have something like breakfast inlcuded rather than paying so much for a room Exchange rate changed by the time we were there and the difference was HUGE also so pay upfront when booking Not allowed to reserve a table for drinks at the rooftop meaning both nights we went up we could not sit down and therefore weren t allowed to have a drink whilst standing Staff tried to accommodate but we went elsewhere after waiting as we were a group of kebersihankebersihan ;kerapihan;1
 Too noisy no view just one high window no inner pool;kerapihan;1
 Two night clubs which open at weekends and public holidays until early hours Room hot due to closure of windows to keep the noise out of the nightclubs below No air conditioning only switched on in June despite being the hottest weekend of the year;kerapihan;1
 Unable to use pool as too cold heated pool ;kerapihan;1
 Unfortunately a huge construction site is right in front of the property I would recommend to mention that during the booking Very bad and strong noise ;kerapihan;1
 Unfortunately there is some construction work across the road and they start at 7am making sleeping in very difficult However the hotel is apologetic for this inconvenience ;kerapihan;1
 Unkind and unprofessional receptionist Uncomfortable pillows Few TV channels and bathroom sets ;kerapihan;1
 Very minor but the pillows could have been better ;kerapihan;1
 very small room not possible to open the window;kerapihan;1
 We asked for a room with a view which was facing the street however while minor you could hear some traffic in the mornings We suggest you ask for a room at the rear ;kerapihan;1
 We asked the staff at the reception for a taxi to the airport Instead they booked us a transfer that turned out to be almost double the price ;kerapihan;1
 We asked where to have proper lunch and the restaurant was closed Had to walk to another direction ;kerapihan;1
 We booked a flight with your travel agent and we were given the wrong locator number We spent most of the day trying to straighten it out Your manager was helpful but we lost a day of our vacation ;kerapihan;1
 We drove to Vienna and when we checked in the woman on front desk directed us to the parking lot she said it was easy just a few streets away but as it turned out she sent us via closed off streets so we sat in bumper to bumper traffic for an hour in a strange city trying to find a new route and ended up back at the hotel and grabbed one of the porters and he knew the roads were closed and took us a different way in 5 mins She never even looked up as we walked past saw her a couple more times waiting for an apology but no Also the room was quite noisy with a building being demolished across the road And for some reason they have taken the doors off the bathroom and toilet and replaced them with glass doors maybe they thought it would modernise the room but it takes away any sound proofing and privacy No hot water on the last day other guests reported the same thing to reception ;kerapihan;1
 We had a junior loft suite and expected a larger suit with a larger bath tub ;kerapihan;1
 We had a plastic curtain instead of a glass door for the bath however it looked clean Super detailed map with all the streets of Vienna without main attractions higlighted difficult to manage if you haven t done any previous researches ;kerapihan;1
 We stayed in room kebersihankenyamanankebersihan which although was very comfortable was next to a waste water pipe which we could hear every so often ;kerapihan;1
 we were disappointed that the children s beds had not been made up when they said they would rather than us arriving back from dinner and having to ask the maids to come at kebersihankenyamananpm the hotel itself is a bit dark and gloomy we found it difficult to get the lights to properly illuminate the room ;kerapihan;1
 Well noise on the street did not allow to sleep with open windows and since AC was not operational yet it was kind of a problem for us since it was too warm in a room We asked to fix it and it became reasonable but still not kebersihankenyamanankenyamanan OK ;kerapihan;1
 Wf not saficient;kerapihan;1
 What seems to be the old pre renovated version of the hotel nextdoor with the hotels name on it Looked really shabby Doesnt seem used except for the luminescent sign ;kerapihan;1
 When we arrived at the hotel the receptionist was a bit too friendly and asked my boyfriend to carry the bags in the room by himself which is very bad We are a young couple however we re used to attend 5 hotels and this never happened anywhere else before I think this should not happen as it s a minimum service to carry the luggage and show us the room When we arrived in the room we where suprised because there was a wall right in front of our window with a man smoking his cigarette and looking at us No intimicy Of course we asked to change the room immediatly and we were offered another room which was fine According to me the staff should anticipate more the client s needs especially if you pretend to be a 5 hotel In addition the rooms are not isolated which means that you litterally hear the other clients flushing the toilet ;kerapihan;1
 Wi fi in my first room simply didn t work luckily I was able to change to another room closer to the router but this shouldn t happen anyway especially as was doing a business conference call ;kerapihan;1
 Wi Fi in room was really really slow Not sure why my telephone manner presented a higher image than seeing me with longish hair but I guess some people are more judgemental on appearance Will be going back as that is the only comment ;kerapihan;1
 Wi fi is not working ;kerapihan;1
 wi Fi not available in the part of the hotel our room was situated;kerapihan;1
 Wifi connection very unstable sometimes good sometimes terrible ;kerapihan;1
 WIFI could be better in my room ;kerapihan;1
 WiFi during the morning hours;kerapihan;1
 WIFI IS TERRIBLE;kerapihan;1
 Wifi was a bit inconsistent in the room and only one could use the network at a time Worked well in common areas of hotel though Coffee machine didn t work too well and would not stop pouring out Did not raise these with hotel staff and I know they would have helped resolve these issues had we have brought them up ;kerapihan;1
 Wifi was a bit patchy in our room;kerapihan;1
 Wifi was not available many times which was a problem for me Breakfast is expensive here There are many cafes restaurants right next door that offer excellent options ;kerapihan;1
 Wifi was not great in our room ;kerapihan;1
 Wish I d checked that there wasn t any parking Parking was an added extra expense Also room was rather disappointing small and no view ;kerapihan;1
 Would have thought a cocktail menu at the roof top bar would have been helpful ;kerapihan;1
 you cannot open the Windows somewhat transfering noise steps when walking from the neighbour rooms ;kerapihan;1
 You need to call and have some one over to open and close the windows They are normally sealed ;kerapihan;1
 A bit overpriced Also didn t get the room specifications that I had requested ;kerapihan;1
 A restaurant would have been nice but with an extension in progress maybe next year ;kerapihan;1
 Absolutely nothing to complain about ;kerapihan;1
 Air conditioning didn t work and roof top bar was closed for one of our two nights stay;kerapihan;1
 Balkony could be better ;kerapihan;1
 Bit expensive for things but this is to be expected really ;kerapihan;1
 Breakfast expensive but inline with all hotels in the area so we didn t purchase it ;kerapihan;1
 Breakfast included in the room price was not possible;kerapihan;1
 Breakfast is overpriced head out to a pavement cafe instead;kerapihan;1
 Breakfast ridiculously overcharged Bedrooms except those overlooking the port were dark and gloomy swimming pool on terrace little bigger than a bath tub ;kerapihan;1
 Breakfast staff never advised when closing the buffet and turned off coffee machine before the end of breakfast ;kerapihan;1
 Breakfast staff slow and not very comptent Not service minded ;kerapihan;1
 Building work ongoing and encountered associated noise of drilling and banging On last night of our stay we were unable to use rooftop bar restaurant only such facilities at hotel as private function had hired it out Disappointed after paying so much unable to use these facilities and take in view on our last night ;kerapihan;1
 Closed the roof top bar at kebersihankebersihanpm had to use next door Hotel;kerapihan;1
 Coffee could have been hotter at breakfast ;kerapihan;1
 construction site next door partly blocking the view from the terrace Suppose it is a temporary thing though ;kerapihan;1
 Construction Zone Construction was going on while we were there with drilling banging and clanging for hours Now I m a heavy sleeper and after a long flight and jet lag I was ready to go into a coma after checking in Luckily it didn t happen at night but with so much noise all chances of us taking a nap were gone This is the worse noise I have every experienced ever at a hotel To make it worse I asked the front desk staff to tell me when the work would be done He said keamanan kenyamanankenyamananpm perfect I though it s kerapihan 55 Only 5 more minutes I can finally sleep Nonetheless the banging clanging and drilling continued on and on for at least another few hours until I went down stairs and told the front desk person we couldn t sleep So I went out sat by the water went to the ATM etc went back to the room still clanging and banging They didn t have any other rooms so they finally called the construction crew and told them to stop the noise By biggest disappointment comes from the lack of transparency on behalf of the front desk staff after I talked to them about it twice In addition they didn t offer a discount or apologize upon checkout I finally asked for a discount and got it It looks like it s going to be a large project and addition to the whole right side of the property It doesn t look like something that will be done quickly In addition if you called and you asked if the work was over I can t be sure you ll get a straight answer ;kerapihan;1
 could have been more storage space no drawers bureaus only the closet ;kerapihan;1
 Could have in the bathroom more shower gel etc I know they were available at reception but that was not always convenient ;kerapihan;1
 Expensive for what you get Way over priced for what I think this property deserves The pool is very small and can barely fit keamanan kenyamanan people more of a big bath rub than a pool Breakfast isnt bad but expensive for what is offered Location is not bad but I would suggest something closer to the downtown rather than closer to the beach on the edge of the city ;kerapihan;1
 Greater selection of English TV Channels;kerapihan;1
 Hotel felt outdated AC didn t work bathrooms were underwhelming For the money we felt like there was better options in the city ;kerapihan;1
 Housekeeping was making too much noise early in the morning all the days we were there ;kerapihan;1
 I could not fault anything about this excellent hotel ;kerapihan;1
 I d have liked a proper balcony ;kerapihan;1
 I did not have breakfast there so I can not comment on the quality but I found the price a little steep which is what put me off ;kerapihan;1
 I felt the swimming pool was very small ;kerapihan;1
 I hate that I didn t get to stay there a little longer ;kerapihan;1
 I thought it a bit noisy but don t be put off we just had bad neighbours and the hustle and bustle of a busy city was ok;kerapihan;1
 I will start from the end If not for one event that cast a shadow on my staying which was for kebersihankebersihan nights I would have given it the highest esteem The event A guest played loud music at the middle of the night for three hours which was too intense to sleep The stuff tried but could not stop him What amazed me is not this particular occasion but the ignorance of the hotel management from it during the rest of my stay at the hotel another kerapihan nights This behavior of the hotel management brought me to degrade my evaluation of the hotel and to a decision not to stay again in this hotel This wasn t my first staying in the hotel but was the last From a quality hotel I expected to get an official apology from the management and a compensation if only symbolically and small to clarify their understanding of the uneasiness of a guest who stayed there for kebersihankebersihan nights ;kerapihan;1
 It was quite cold in the evening and although the view was spectacular it would have been good to have a proper bar and dinner served in the breakfast room The restaurant prices were high ;kerapihan;1
 It would have been nice to have access to a larger pool but we were very close to the water ;kerapihan;1
 Its an expensive hotel;kerapihan;1
 Lobby area of the hotel was just ok Pool very small It s really just a small plunge pool No bar inside the hotel so if you are there outside summer like us it s a bit cold in the evening times to enjoy a drink in the open air ;kerapihan;1
 Maintenance of the shower plugged drain Friendliness of breakfast waitresses ;kerapihan;1
 More coffee Milk in the rooms please ;kerapihan;1
 My expectations of the room never met the price I paid;kerapihan;1
 Nightime noise from street;kerapihan;1
 No view rooms should be cheaper than a room with a city view ;kerapihan;1
 Not directly related to the hotel but more related to the general city condition I am quite sensitive to noise and we stayed in a room right on a noisy side street However this is just a proof of how lively Barcelona is I was prepared with my earplugs so it is a recommendation to anyone who is a light sleeper bring your earplugs in case ;kerapihan;1
 Not much to be honest;kerapihan;1
 Nothing great choice for Barcelona ;kerapihan;1
 Nothing It was great stay all in all with gave us access to many close by locations like beach Marina Telefric mountain shopping streets etc;kerapihan;1
 Nothing th complain about;kerapihan;1
 Nothing wish I would have stayed longer;kerapihan;1
 Old hotel small;kerapihan;1
 Only kerapihan small pots of milk each day but we were given more when we asked Some noise from the reception heard due to the room being just off the mezzanine ;kerapihan;1
 Our room overlooked a main road resulting in traffic noise at night Also A C couldn t be adjusted resulting in room being too warm at night ;kerapihan;1
 Our room was like a cave so dark I payed 5kenyamanankenyamanan for kerapihan nights without breakfast We need to have the lights on all the time ;kerapihan;1
 Overall the bed was very uncomfortable especially the pillows so i didn t have a great nights sleep i had a back room without a view so a view is your thing then pay the extra because you certainly don t get one if you don t I stayed at kerapihan other Hotels 5 star which were slightly cheaper and in my opinion much more superior in terms of location professionalism and friendliness of staff and overall comfort;kerapihan;1
 Overpriced breakfast wouldn t buy next time as you can find a lot cheaper places to eat just around the corner Small pool looks a lot bigger in the picture ;kerapihan;1
 Pick up at the airport was late ;kerapihan;1
 Pool is very small ;kerapihan;1
 Pool needed cleaning and refurbishment as ladder broken ;kerapihan;1
 Pool was too small;kerapihan;1
 Price a little too high;kerapihan;1
 Price of breakfast Not very good for the money ;kerapihan;1
 pub bar too noisy tvs blaring;kerapihan;1
 Quite expensive Thought pool was bigger than it was in reality ;kerapihan;1
 Roof top bar closed at kebersihanam;kerapihan;1
 Rooftop bar closed at kebersihankebersihan ;kerapihan;1
 Rooftop pool a bit small ;kerapihan;1
 Room felt claustrophobic dark as there was only one window which opened onto a narrow alley with another building kebersihankenyamanan feet away ;kerapihan;1
 room I had was a bit cramped;kerapihan;1
 Room was average and a little small;kerapihan;1
 Room was facing a courtyard and a little dark Hot water took quite a long time to come through ;kerapihan;1
 Room with great view of harbour but street noisy if window opened ;kerapihan;1
 rooms very small but with such a beautiful city we didn t spend much time in them;kerapihan;1
 Should include breakfast which was expensive;kerapihan;1
 shower would drain on the floor as it did not appear to be sloped correctly but the staff assisted the best they could ;kerapihan;1
 Since it was a quadruple room the table could be bigger with additional kerapihan more chairs to accommodate all kenyamanan guests ;kerapihan;1
 size of room but we opted out of upgrading;kerapihan;1
 Some of the buildings on the same road are not in the best condition which is unusual for the city but don t let it put you off ;kerapihan;1
 Staff at the pool terrace was kind but inefficient Staff at reception was cold and not very helpful Serious need for more hooks or towel racks in the bathroom Room not as shown no balcony rather dark with a musty smell Booking com site states Enjoy a free welcome drink upon arrival which we did not get Overall pricey for what we got I feel we had the cheap room and service to match ;kerapihan;1
 Staff on the terrace wasn t nice as the reception also we had a tea and they served it cold ;kerapihan;1
 Surprised with our evening drink we were given olives but when asked if we could have some nuts the bowl of olives were taken away Breakfasts weren t good value for money luckily not included in our price of room ;kerapihan;1
 Swimming pool is quite too small;kerapihan;1
 Swimming pool was too small;kerapihan;1
 Terrace service was poor The pool on the terrace is about the size of a bathtub ;kerapihan;1
 The AC wasn t working our first night so it became a bit warm But it was fixed shortly after telling the front desk ;kerapihan;1
 The cocktails served on the Roof Terrace were not good didn t deserve the prices charged The staff on the roof Terrace were not of a consistently high standard Twice we were almost moved off sun beds at 6 keamanankenyamananpm to suit the staff in preparing early for evening set up You don t stock Cointreau in your bar which was disappointing ;kerapihan;1
 The construction noise When there s a discount it s for a reason I told them but the first day they blamed another building On Teusday morning I was woken up at 9 am in my holiday by hammer in the next room to mine and when I told the fro t desk there was just silence ;kerapihan;1
 The food was a bit expensive ;kerapihan;1
 The furniture was a bit old The breakfast is too expensive with kebersihan8 Euro Bakerys and Caf s are offering a breakfast for less than kebersihankenyamanan Euro For kebersihankerapihan Euro as instance I guess that the most would prefer to have breakfast at the hotel ;kerapihan;1
 the main meal we had in the restaurant was disappointing ;kerapihan;1
 The noise from the traffic on the busy road outside was very audible ;kerapihan;1
 The pool looked bigger in the photos;kerapihan;1
 The pool wasn t very big warm or cleaned I m not sure if it s in use certain times of the year However this didn t affect our stay at all and hope this doesn t stop anyone from booking ;kerapihan;1
 The port view rooms have the view blocked by trees so no port view in fact;kerapihan;1
 The room was dated and tired Dark colours in room Sink was not emptying and the shower taps coming away from wall Maid was not sweeping the floor daily and even left us without toilet paper its not what yiu expect from a kenyamanan star hotel which clearly it isn t We complained and although the room was cleaned the next day the sink remained blocked It was expensive for quality of accomodation Next time we will go Eurostars Marina similar price but outstanding Staff friendly ;kerapihan;1
 The room we stayed in had a very small window and poor view;kerapihan;1
 The rooms are nice but not amazing value for the price ;kerapihan;1
 The service at the roof top restaurant was not great Some staff did not speak English which made getting an order understood difficult Food sometimes took a long time to come out Most importantly there were many errors made in the bills multiple times which was a bit fishy ;kerapihan;1
 the shortness of our stay;kerapihan;1
 The shower floor was always wet and cold as the water never fully drained The shower head was a little tricky and not very strong ;kerapihan;1
 The small roof top pool is more of a plunge pool;kerapihan;1
 The terrace bar staff came round with some tapas didn t tell us the cost or make it clear it was going to cost us and it was very expensive Also no parking available at the property although we found parking around the city was reasonably priced ;kerapihan;1
 The terrace restaurant was poor Both staff and food Also the cafe in the lobby Breakfast was nice However the coffee and orange juice should be served by the staff Milk was never hot enough We all found the coffee machines confusing to work We are on holiday and expect some service for our kebersihan8 Euros per person ;kerapihan;1
 There is nothing in which we didn t like ;kerapihan;1
 Too expensive for a kenyamanan star hotel;kerapihan;1
 Tried your charge me 7 5 euros for kerapihan small and I mean small scoops of ice cream Only when I questioned this they said it was a mistake and offered a refund however for me credibility had been lost ;kerapihan;1
 Two minor complaints would be that the english channels on the tv didn t work properly and that the laundry service was extremely expensive ;kerapihan;1
 very small balcony ;kerapihan;1
 Waiter girl at terrace stressed ;kerapihan;1
 We decided not to have the breakfast as it seemed expensive ;kerapihan;1
 WE DID NOT TAKE BREAKFAST AT THE HOTEL TOO PRICEY UNLESS ONE EATS A GREAT DEAL;kerapihan;1
 We had trouble with the hot water in two occasions On one day the water was boiling hot and no matter what we tried we couldn t use the shower we didn t tell the management about that The next day there was no hot water so we called the management It is worth mentioning that they acted quickly and in the end the problem was solved They kindly offered a discount for the inconvenience plus free breakfast for the remaining of our stay I certainly hope this will not discourage anyone from staying at the Duquesa de Cardona I for one will certainly stay there again ;kerapihan;1
 We heard traffic at night from our sea view room ;kerapihan;1
 We were late in arriving as there was a suspicious bag left at airport so it was locked down Explained this to guy at reception who was very uninterested and not welcoming at all He handed us our card to get in to room and told us how to get there After dropping off our cases in room we went to roof top bar for a quick snack and drink as had not had anything for hours They had stopped serving food which was fair enough but they couldn t offer us anything even after I explained the situation at the airport olives bread crisps would have been great We then asked for water to take to our room as there was none in the room but they didn t sell any at the bar Breakfast was reasonable but it would have been nice to have had different choices each day particularly the hot food same choice each day On the second day we noticed another table getting a menu which we since found out was for different cooked eggs We were not offered this On the last morning we decided to pack our suitcases before going for breakfast so didn t get down until kebersihankenyamanan kebersihankenyamananam breakfast was 8 kenyamanankenyamananam kebersihankenyamanan keamanankenyamananam After some fruit and coffee we were told as was everyone else that we had kebersihankenyamanan minutes to put what we wanted on plates as everything was being taken away Every place we ve been to in the past if breakfast was kenyamanan8 kenyamanankenyamanan kebersihankenyamanan keamanankenyamanan you could go down at kebersihankenyamanan keamanankenyamanan and get the same service and breakfast as you would at kenyamanan8 kenyamanankenyamanan without being rushed Unfriendly unwelcoming reception breakfast choice not being offered what we should have been and being rushed no water in room being offered nothing to eat after being kept at airport for hours all seem rather trivial but for the cost and what the hotel promote themselves as I expected more ;kerapihan;1
 While the room was very comfortable it did not have a view of the harbour which I had requested ;kerapihan;1
 WiFi rubbish Didnt get to try breakfast ;kerapihan;1
 Wish we could stay longer ;kerapihan;1
 Would be great if they could extend the pool hours upstairs 7pm seemed a bit early to take the sun loungers away ;kerapihan;1
 A basic continental breakfast without any particular great taste or dish good but not great ;kerapihan;1
 a bit far away from the center of amsterdam ;kerapihan;1
 A bit far from the city center but very well connected through the public transport tram line 5 ;kerapihan;1
 A bit far out of the centre for the price although short walk to the tram ;kerapihan;1
 A bit of travelling to city;kerapihan;1
 A little out of town but there are good transport links tram or metro round the corner And it s really not too far to walk to the centre on a nice day kerapihan 5 miles ;kerapihan;1
 A little outside the city centre approximately kebersihankm from the large Station Zuid train metro station 6kenyamanankenyamananm from the tram stop that takes you directly into the city centre or the museum quarter out of the front of the hotel and turn left Tram line 5 ;kerapihan;1
 A little way out of the main tourist centre Easy to get to by public transport but requires some walking from the train tram station A directory explaining how to operate the appliances safe is needed ;kerapihan;1
 A minor issue which was easily resolved was that there were no larger cups for making tea in our room ;kerapihan;1
 Although breakfast choice excellent as self service breakfast area very congested and coffee machine inadequate as very slow delivering coffee This resulted in long queues Seating also insufficient resulting in people needing to stand whilst eating breakfast ;kerapihan;1
 Amenities not stocked daily and location is about an hours walk to central only two bikes for rent Terrible breakfast for the amount of guests Very corporate;kerapihan;1
 As a fairly new hotel it was faultless ;kerapihan;1
 As the hotel was recently inaugurated is a little hard to find ;kerapihan;1
 Booking com charging me full price for children ;kerapihan;1
 Breakfast area is too small When choosing Breakfast you have to be prepared to get knocked into ;kerapihan;1
 Breakfast assortment is rather poor it is really affecting negatively the overall experience;kerapihan;1
 Breakfast coffe machine capacity must be improved ;kerapihan;1
 Breakfast could be little better there is little weird smell in halls shower cabin looks great but it is very impractical;kerapihan;1
 Breakfast could have more variety Lack of breakfast tables if you go late;kerapihan;1
 Breakfast I consider it too healthy Just for vegetarians Buy some solid staff in the mall food store No available olive or other oils even salt is not at hand you should ask for it but healthier pepper is on table The only positive in breakfast fresh and good bread Very expensive car parking a way to discourage use of polluting cars ;kerapihan;1
 Breakfast is a turn off we had the same menu on all kenyamanan days of our stay so much so that we skipped the breakfast on the last day ;kerapihan;1
 Breakfast is not much for choice ;kerapihan;1
 breakfast is poor they did not change the coffee tea water in the room;kerapihan;1
 Breakfast is weak ;kerapihan;1
 Breakfast rush;kerapihan;1
 Breakfast selection is poor bread croissants yogurt boiled eggs and only one type of cheese Parking is not free around keamanan5 EUR per day In one occasion they didn t come to clean our room Location itself is nothing remarkable ;kerapihan;1
 Breakfast should have a more diverse offer but it was tasty ;kerapihan;1
 Breakfast was boring with limited variety Needs more protein options;kerapihan;1
 breakfast was disappointing and staff weren t the most helpful;kerapihan;1
 Breakfast was good but it would be great to have some healthier options available;kerapihan;1
 Breakfast was weak and repetitive Lots of dust behind the sofa They take 5min to do the cleaning Miss the toiletries Worst toilet paper ever;kerapihan;1
 Could be cheaper ;kerapihan;1
 Couldn t fault the hotel at all just wish it would of been a bit closer to centrum;kerapihan;1
 Distance from city center;kerapihan;1
 Distance from public transport Consider free shuttle service from Amsterdam Zuid Station to hotel for guests on arrival ;kerapihan;1
 Do not stay if you like a piece of salami meat fish and or vegetables for breakfast as you will not find it there ;kerapihan;1
 Element Amsterdam would make a great service to their property by training their staff better One day I called the reception about misunderstanding with the cleaning personnel The reception promised to return to us but it never happened I waited for the whole evening We were put in an invalid room that was not the coziest one There were these small things said by the personnel that make you feel they wish you to be gone Telling kerapihan hours before check out that you can leave already when you ask whether the check out is until kebersihankerapihan Not asking how your stay was Not showing any appreciation that you stayed for 5 nights Not providing tea bags etc in your room daily Maybe there are just too many tourists in Amsterdam ;kerapihan;1
 Element is rather far from key transport stops takes a bit of time to reach the center of Amsterdam s action But if you don t mind a bit of a stroll have time to get from one point to another it s really not a big deal ;kerapihan;1
 Everyrhing was great the breakfast was basic but not bad ;kerapihan;1
 Everything was good nothing to suggest;kerapihan;1
 fire alarm goes off middle of the night due to another guest cooking in the room Probably management should give strict instructions to guests;kerapihan;1
 For me the location is perfect Just be aware it is not in the historic centre of town It does not claim to be and personally I love the quiet sophistication of the Buitenveldert locale and the easy access to the Oud Zuid Old South area of the city Just check your maps first and decide what you want ;kerapihan;1
 For me the location was bad as it is very far from city center we had to take kerapihan taxis every day which was a waste of time and money ;kerapihan;1
 Having to check out and go home ;kerapihan;1
 Having to pay kebersihankenyamanankenyamanan euro per room deposit;kerapihan;1
 Hot breakfast was missing didnt expected that ;kerapihan;1
 Hotel team was rude maybe when we got to the management level and complained I guess the customer is never right when we asked for extra blacked at kerapihankebersihan we got it at kerapihankeamanan as there was one person on shift Breakfast was very poor limited healthy offer toasts got stuck water were jammed in the kitchen sink and too strong air co got us sick as we could not regulate Finally location beside the fact its next to a shopping mall it very far from the tram station and center of Amsterdam ;kerapihan;1
 Housekeeping is poor and seem short of staff Towel not replaced totally Compliment bottle of water only supplied the first night and no more penalizing longer stay customers;kerapihan;1
 I didn t like how the staff wasn t very helpful at receiption not telling us how to use our room key and the elevators then at breakfast no one saw to us to explain how it worked or when we could have our breakfast It was a shame that you only were aloud one bottle of water and two coffees in your room and we were there kenyamanan days for the price of the hotel you would expect a bit better service We wasn t told about having to have a deposit down also so when we arrived we wasn t aloud in our room because we had spent all of our money paying for the room already to then be told they wanted another kebersihan5kenyamanan out of us So we hung around not knowing if we re going to have a hotel for our holiday although we had already spent nearly kenyamanankenyamanankenyamanan for just the room Hotel was nice just a shame no one seemed like they wanted to work there and be helpful at all ;kerapihan;1
 I have booked two rooms and was asked for placing two security deposits of EUR 5kenyamanan each So the hotel just charged me everything rooms and securit deposits I am a busy person and now they keep sending me filled documents back as there is some logo missing The worst is that I was asking the counter desk person and he assured me that they never charge the amounts but they did ;kerapihan;1
 I have to say that the only thing that l didn t like was brekfast It is advertised as a lot of healthy options etc and l was looking forward to it but it was pretty basic and dry Some bread and cheese waffles butter There was nothing green like salad tomatoes cucumbers no mayo or red sauce There was nothing available from kichen things like omelette fried egg porridge etc The only healthy thing available was two types of smoothies but they were constantly running out Coffee wasnt great not bad but not good The staff and service at the brekfast was very slow tables were not cleaned quick enough to allow new people to be seated coffee machine was breaking up running out of food Generally people looked frustrated as they had to wait to find a clean table and queue to get some coffee etc If l would stay there again l woud not pay for brekfast as it not my type of brekfast at all The hotel is located within shopping centre there are coffee shops and food markets to buy things ;kerapihan;1
 I little hard to find at the start need a number 5 or 5kebersihan tram and go kerapihan stops beyond Amsterdam Zuid ;kerapihan;1
 I m a full English kinda girl Breakfast was included in my package but I didn t bother;kerapihan;1
 I thought the breakfast could have been a little better was just standard There wasn t much space to sit everyone either especially at the weekends when the hotel was busy ;kerapihan;1
 I was here attending a conference at the nearby university which is kebersihan5 mins walk away The city however is far from the hotel and if I were a tourist I would find it too far at least kenyamanan5mins tram ride plus walk The city itself is beautiful and is nothing like where the hotel is located It s safe and clean but nothing much to look at I was also quite disappointed by the staff The man I checked in with could have been friendlier When checking out I asked for a taxi at keamananpm When it didn t show up after keamanan I asked and was told I should wait a bit more At keamanan kenyamanan9 I asked again I was pacing in front of them and they never came to ask They made a call and I was told the taxi was stuck in traffic and should arrive in 5 mins The taxi didn t arrive till keamanan kerapihankerapihan and I was getting very nervous I spoke with the driver and I believed that the company never got a call from the hotel until keamanan kenyamanan9 I was very disappointed that they messed up my taxi booking and did not apologise for their mistake ;kerapihan;1
 If its raining the walk to the metro is a bit long;kerapihan;1
 If you came to the breakfast at around 9 it was pretty cleaned out;kerapihan;1
 irritating displays on Cooker TV etc to disturb sleep ;kerapihan;1
 It was a bit of a trek to get downtown but the public transport is great Not much in the way of local restaurants ;kerapihan;1
 It was cold the AC was stuck kerapihankenyamanan C the wi fi was slow and there was no floor drain of water in the bathroom ;kerapihan;1
 It wasn t easy to go from the Hotel to the airport early on thw morning We had to walk about kebersihankerapihan minutes to catch bus keamanankebersihankenyamanan Also the distance from the Elemnet to Metro and tram it was kebersihankenyamanan minutes walking ;kerapihan;1
 It will cost about kenyamanankenyamanan euros for a taxi to the airport Use local transport if you can approx 7 euros unlimited for kerapihankenyamanan hours ;kerapihan;1
 Lack of breakfast options and the windows in hotel room do not open;kerapihan;1
 late checkin time after keamanan pm;kerapihan;1
 laundry equipment did not work properly instructions should be available to operate stove etc ;kerapihan;1
 Laundry facility could be improved i e Add tv include basket In room to transport laundry;kerapihan;1
 lights at the room was too weak ;kerapihan;1
 little choice for breakfast unsupportive suff I asked what was the best way to get to central station and was roughly advised to get to the street and have a walk I finally got lost unpleasant experience with heavy luggage why did noone tell me that taxi might be a better option also i asked to check if the bagage lockers at central station were open as the site was in Dutch only but i was refused overall very upset with how the check out went ;kerapihan;1
 Little wall to the tram train but without the children this was fine;kerapihan;1
 Location a bit far out but transport links very good ;kerapihan;1
 Location is far from centre but with a metro or tram station 6 minutes away Then kerapihankenyamanan min ride to centre;kerapihan;1
 Location is good for business purposes kebersihankenyamanan minutes walk to WTC However if you would like to visit Amsterdam center it s a little bit far;kerapihan;1
 Location Some effort to walk to and from the tram stop but we didn t mind ;kerapihan;1
 Location Takes kebersihankenyamanan minutes to walk to tram and it takes kerapihankenyamanan kerapihan5 minutes to Dam square Total keamanankenyamanan minutes if you are lucky ;kerapihan;1
 Location was far out therefore eating out was limited lack of bars or restaurants;kerapihan;1
 Lot of dust everywhere TV table kitchenette surface coffee maker etc Crumbs of food in freezer on table and so on We stayed there for kenyamanan nights and dust was not cleaned during our stay Room service only change towels one towel was dirty on arrival and make bed Soap not available in bathroom only wall fixed and broken showering gel dispenser in shower Shower was leaking to bathroom so after taking it you need to mop the whole bathroom Breakfast was acceptable on weekend but choice reduced on weekdays Looks like management invested a lot to build good looking and comfortable hotel but personnel is ruining it For example vacuum cleaner stayed dropped in corridor for keamanan days until someone removed it ;kerapihan;1
 Maybe slightly nearer the city but as mentioned before not a huge problem as so easy to use trams etc;kerapihan;1
 more instruction in bedroom on how to use safe hob phone menu very limited in restaurant;kerapihan;1
 no baby crib ;kerapihan;1
 No duvet provided but a quilt that s a little heavy and stuffy ;kerapihan;1
 No free slippers ;kerapihan;1
 No mention of gym ;kerapihan;1
 No plastic bags for the bins livingroom kitchen and bathroom which I think it s essential particularly when you have a kitchenette inside your studio because at some point if you cook or eat something you will need a rubbish bin to dispose your leftovers A part from that everything was perfect ;kerapihan;1
 No room service no warm breakfast options e g scramble eggs;kerapihan;1
 Not a good place to stay with a small kid no transportation is being provided from airport and vice versa house cleaning is not upto the mark the kitchen utensils were never cleaned properly towels were never changed regularly;kerapihan;1
 Not cheap so special offers would be much appreciated ;kerapihan;1
 Not enough bars close to location but this has nothing to do with the hotel ;kerapihan;1
 Not much choice for breakfast No car park;kerapihan;1
 not much happening in the neighbourhood hotel restaurant way too expensive and closes early the price for this property was heavily discounted by some 5kenyamanan truth be told although it was a very comfortable hotel the originally quoted price would have been too much so if such generous discounts aren t normally available when booking well in advance i d call this property over priced breakfast is good and fresh but little variety and selection ;kerapihan;1
 Not so central so didn t provide any special view also bit expensive ;kerapihan;1
 Not the ambience of the central parts of Amsterdam but that is our problem and not that of the hotel or area ;kerapihan;1
 Nothing has to be improved;kerapihan;1
 Nothing I think it s a good choice ;kerapihan;1
 One can always find problems The view wasn t the greatest but not the worst either The outside restaurants associated with the Element was going through some growing pains during our stay but as I said several other places to eat close by or buy some food and prepare in the room ;kerapihan;1
 One of the days we were there they straightened the room but didn t clean it The location was a bit outside of the city which was nice but is little daunting if you re walking back from the tram after dark ;kerapihan;1
 Only supplied kerapihan capsules of coffee during my kerapihan night stay and did not replace lotion My complaint is with Booking com Price went kebersihankenyamanankenyamanan lower for a deluxe studio Was told if it was a studio the price could be adjusted When a lower price for the studio appeared they said no Won t book with Booking com again as prices fluctuate lower then higher then lower I booked because the prices kept going up Buyer Beware ;kerapihan;1
 Only very minor things some kitchenware missing once the room was not cleaned which surely would have been fixed if we asked the reception ;kerapihan;1
 Parking although it is in a mall and they are negotiating with the mall to have use of their car park facilities I am disabled with a blue card so I was able to park across the road but you can use the car park to unload as there is an entrance to the hotel in there and then you can park a couple of minutes walk away at Frieslandstraat Accessible bathroom I would have liked to have seen a fold up seat in there as I cannot use my own wheelchair in the shower I suggested to the staff that they may wish to review the heavy sliding mirrored door to the wet room difficult enough for my able bodied daughter to open someone with dexterity problems would have a nightmare of a time opening and closing it I have a little gripe about the food Don t get me wrong the food is superb even though the menu is fairly limited it is super quality food My gripe is that after a busy day travelling or sightseeing one is tired and hungry The beautifully presented food is very chic and therein lies the problem I think The portions are too small Starters are 6 5kenyamanan Euros and mains are kebersihankerapihan 5kenyamanan Euros I wouldn t mind paying a little more and having a bigger meal ;kerapihan;1
 Parking was kebersihankenyamanankenyamanan for two days ;kerapihan;1
 parking wasn t available on site and a bit an inconvience to go to the nearest public garage ;kerapihan;1
 Prices are very high ;kerapihan;1
 Quiet location outside the city Parking was in shopping mall and expensive ;kerapihan;1
 Quite far from the centre;kerapihan;1
 Replenishment of the tea and coffee in room would have been nice Perhaps they don t do that sort of thing in The Netherlands Just grab some breakfast tea bags As for coffee you d have to source those elsewhere yourself The kerapihan small windows would not open After investigating I found out why and fixed them up no worries ;kerapihan;1
 room service food not available after certain times ;kerapihan;1
 Room was very poorly cleaned No clean sheets on bed despite staying for kenyamanan nights Even the gym was not regularly cleaned ;kerapihan;1
 Rooms weren t cleaned properly everyday and very late in the afternoon;kerapihan;1
 Shutting off the breakfast bang on time even leaving those inside the restaurant high and dry Is not a good sign ;kerapihan;1
 Size of the studio is smaller than what the description kerapihan9 sq meters of the hotel claims The room is dusty more care and effort should be made on vacuum cleaning Coffee and tea in the room is supplied on arrival only One trash bin should be included in the kitchen area ;kerapihan;1
 Small selection of food for breakfast;kerapihan;1
 Some pots more in the kitchen would have been welcome;kerapihan;1
 Somehow far from the city center but good tram connection to Dam square ;kerapihan;1
 Sometimes water gets on the bathroom floor while you re taking shower ;kerapihan;1
 Staff very slow at cleaning tables at breakfast twice we had to clear them ourselves ;kerapihan;1
 That we can t find anything to criticise ;kerapihan;1
 The bar closed quite early ;kerapihan;1
 The bar prices were extremely expensive for a hotel nowhere near the city centre ;kerapihan;1
 The breakfast is very simple The is no fried egg option On the average I give 5 6 out of kebersihankenyamanan to breakfast Hotel is far away from the center Take this into account while reserving The surrounding is quite and nice area Nearest metro statin is about 7kenyamanankenyamanan 9kenyamanankenyamananm So for shoppers I do not recommend this hotel The city center takea about kerapihankenyamanan keamanankenyamananm depending on where you want to go Price vs quality I think that you can find more balanced deals elsewhere ;kerapihan;1
 The breakfast lacked healthy options No porridge and no greens berries No omelette either When I asked for greens I got a plate full of rucola with pesto Strange No natural yoghurt just hard and stiff quark One morning I asked for natural yoghurt and eventually got it the other day the same member of the staff told me that quark was yoghurt That was strange and funny They should do something about airconditioning it turned on automatically every morning even though I had turned it off and I got sick as always do with aircon The fire alarm went off in the middle of the night and we were forced to go out Reason a couple had prepared food and burned something Maybe the stoves should be automatically turned off at kebersihankenyamanan PM Too small trash can Recycling for paper and bottles but why not for bio waste Small adjustments nearly perfect hotel ;kerapihan;1
 The breakfast was terrible scrambled eggs and no meat;kerapihan;1
 The cleanliness of the room floor was so dusty and under the sofa there was a huge amount of dust as if it is never removed for cleaning The kitchen can be better equipped for bigger families it hardly serves kerapihan people and can be further equipped with additional supplies for ease of use ;kerapihan;1
 The dust in the room;kerapihan;1
 The entrance is somewhat difficult to find next to the entrance of the mall Breakfast is adequate but could be improved more variety ;kerapihan;1
 The hotel has WiFi keys to open room doors Well in my case they worked poorly and needed at least 6 or 7 times going back to the reception for new cards ;kerapihan;1
 The hotel is new and the first impression is Wow However when I went for breakfast in the morning I was surprised to see that there was nothing to eat but bread keamananrd grade cheese kind of ham and green melon Next surprise came when I returned from work at kebersihan8 keamanankenyamananh and found out that nobody cleaned my room Well I had to be very noisy at the reception to get my room s towels changed and litter bin replaced I wish they cleaned the the floor too Vacuum cleaning technology hasn t come to this hotel yet Mop is a dirty job for a room keeper so forget it Many people commented here that the hotel has good location Maybe if you go to Amsterdam for shopping in a small mall with kebersihankenyamanan shops or to buy cheap beer from the supermarket The reality is that the nearest metro station is kebersihan5min away fast walking and another kerapihan5 minutes ride in the train to reach the center of the city In fact I was much faster with the bike I was lucky to get from the lobby as there are only two bikes for all guests ;kerapihan;1
 The hotel is not far from the center but the metro takes about keamanankenyamanan minutes to Dam square So little bit of traveltime and planning is nessasary but this is not something you should let stop you The hotel service and staff are great ;kerapihan;1
 The hotel location is far from the city center There are very limited options if you are planning late dinner kerapihankerapihan kenyamanankenyamanan all closed The hotel facilities can be much better including TV channels And the breakfast time menubar prices menu should be reviewed by hotel management to have better grading ;kerapihan;1
 The hotel needs more signage hard for people to find;kerapihan;1
 The hotel needs more staff as on weekends and evenings when house keeping has left there is only one person on reception so if you have any problems they cannot send anyone to the room to help The staff that are there are helpful and polite ;kerapihan;1
 The hotel was a bit far away from the city centre We spent two nights in this hotel and we was frightened by two fire alarms The first one in the 9PM on Friday and the second on Saturday s midnight We were really frightened that something happened but the alarm starts because of too hot showers Hotel stuff apologized but still it was very disturbing ;kerapihan;1
 The hotel was a bit far out from the city center but it s only a minor issue ;kerapihan;1
 The light over the table could have been brighter for reading purposes Relatively far from the center where the action is ;kerapihan;1
 The location was not as convenient as I thought about a 5 minute walk from the tram stop line 5 but not as close to South Station as I had thought The surroudings are not very interesting This hotel aims at long stay visitors which was not clear from the booking The atmosphere lacked warmth and personality ;kerapihan;1
 The location was to far away from the main tourism part of amsterdam although it states different on your website one night a cleaner had left our door on the latch luckily nothing was stolen out of our room but still abit careless also the breakfast is not at all apealing for an english person ;kerapihan;1
 The location wasn t as close to the town center as I d liked but the close tram nearby ensured it was an easy journey to get there ;kerapihan;1
 The nespresso capsules were not replenished on Saturday ;kerapihan;1
 The only area of improvement I would recommend is in the breakfast It was very one dimensional and boring More fruits cheeses vegetables and a different additional flavor could help ;kerapihan;1
 The only issue is that there wasn t the choice of a full English breakfast ;kerapihan;1
 The only thing I could fault was the hotel withdrew kerapihankenyamanankenyamanan from my account without any explanation before hand They asked for credit card details upon arrival and I noticed kerapihandays later kerapihankenyamanankenyamanan Was withdrawn by Element Hotel When I went to reception the receptionist explained it was a deposit I just felt it would be better to have known this before my trip It went straight back into account on check out ;kerapihan;1
 The plates glasses cups and cutlery used during breakfast were not clean The first teacup I grabbed had a lipstick stain on it the first plate some unidentifiable stain Gross The cold drinks during breakfast were also below average the orange juice was undrinkable the rest bad the hot drinks were served in thermos bottles that were wrongly labeled Refilling both foods and beverages during breakfast was also done very poorly ;kerapihan;1
 The reception guys are kind but not well informed at all The first day sent us to a bike shop and told us that we would receive a discount as customers of the hotel but the shop had no clue about this offer Same thing about the keukenhof gardens One told us that the hotel has an offer the other denied it Another annoying thing was that they were closing the breakfast buffet earlier or exactly the indicated time I went to refill my coffee and they did not let me at kebersihankenyamanan kenyamanan5 Last thing was that we had a hard plastic shaker and some coffee with us to make coffee at the room which went missing the first time they cleaned up our room ;kerapihan;1
 The room was not cleaned until 5 kenyamanankenyamananpm ;kerapihan;1
 The selection of breakfast very poor hardly any healthy options no ham scrambled eggs restaurant staff very slow not attentive they asked us to sit at the bar very busy place cramed in tiny room also not enough tables for such big hotel We skipped breakfast for the remaining kerapihan days They don t set the tables either Our room did not get cleaned on kebersihan day at all or missing toiletries or did not put sheets on extra blanket For such expensive place these few things are spoiling otherwise a very nice hotel ;kerapihan;1
 The shower cubicle for the room didn t have full doors so water did spray out there was no handwash soap but this was only a minor inconvenience ;kerapihan;1
 The times for the breakfast were very strictly kept even in days with too many customers It was acceptable we were noticed about but unnecessary The breakfast was quite good but could be better for such a perfect hotel ;kerapihan;1
 The wi fi worked fine in overall but sometimes it gets weak and we had to go out to the hall near elevator where the signal gets strong again and then it worked well again in the room ;kerapihan;1
 There is nothing I did not like It was amazing ;kerapihan;1
 They have only keamanan bikes for rental so you have to be really lucky to get one ;kerapihan;1
 They struggled to keep the room clean they had a housekeeping issue complained and got sorted;kerapihan;1
 To far from city centre;kerapihan;1
 Too much expensive I made a reservation though Booking com which said the payment will have to be made directly to the property on the spot but actually the mount had been already deducted from my account I reserved the hotel for my colleague from Japan therefore if the payment is reducted from my account the things would be complicated The receptonist who was nice kindly credited on the spot the amount paid The system should have been sdjusted to the booking com indication ;kerapihan;1
 Unfortunately on the morning of checkout it was extremely slow took me about kerapihankenyamanan kerapihan5minutes as there was a large wait and made me rush for my morning meeting ;kerapihan;1
 Upon arrival we was not given any details of the gym facilities or not offered any information about the local area and the bike facilities ;kerapihan;1
 Very bad room service;kerapihan;1
 Very expensive for what is just a good hotel nothing particularly special ;kerapihan;1
 Very far from center of town Breakfast very poor for the quality of the facility Sometimes chose to make my own;kerapihan;1
 Very messy and poorly organised breakfast A lot of people crowding in a limited area and food finishing quickly Also poor variety of fruit and a very very slow coffee machine need to change that as it is not in line with the overall standard of the hotel which is quite good ;kerapihan;1
 Very Poor TV Signal kenyamanan days of Relaxing spoiled by poor TV signal and constant stream of staff entering your room to fix it Underground Hotel parking very expensive better to park elsewhere Towels not new and fluffy ;kerapihan;1
 Very very very far from city centre;kerapihan;1
 Was no air conditioning and no alternative blankets thermostat in room did not work If I would have known would not have stayed there but they advertised the aC as being in all the rooms Had to borrow blanket and Fan from a family member ;kerapihan;1
 We had a piece of bread lay on the ground in the corner since our arrival It stayed there for kerapihan night when on keamananrd we moved the bin aside so that cleaning lady could see it Lack of warm food during breakfast mostly cereals waffles croissants meat for sandwiches and cheese and some pancakes ;kerapihan;1
 We had slight issue with keeping the room as cool as we wanted it ;kerapihan;1
 We managed to get free bikes from the hotel great idea in Amsterdam but I was unlucky to puncture a tire and got charged kenyamanan5EUR to replace it You can rent a bike for kenyamanan days and you won t be charged for a punctured tire at a rental place for kenyamanan5EUR For this reason I wouldn t recommend taking the free bikes from the hotel you re better off renting somewhere else May I suggest the hotel reviews this policy to truly be a Wonderful place to stay ;kerapihan;1
 We ve made our reservation several days after the hotel was open for visitors and keamanan months prior our stay There were a lot of free rooms At our arrival we were surprised to find out that we could not have the rooms with kerapihan separate beds as we have requested The girl at the reception desk explained that booking com could not guarantee that we will receive the rooms that we have asked for and that we should have made our reservation directly with them ;kerapihan;1
 Well location is a problem This hotel is far away from the city where the museums and the attractions are There should be more advice about how to get about by trams to the city The advertised bicycles did not exist which was a disappointment The restaurant in the hotel was lovely but have to say the portions were too small I had been travelling from Finland and had been on the road plus than kebersihankerapihan hours and I was hungry I did not return to this restaurant for that reason even that the food was lovely and service good I just needed more value for money Breakfast was full of low nutrition white wheat products rolls waffles etc which I do not regard as healthy food Maybe serve more foods which are not just white flour and sugar Coffee was good and the cold cuts Some salad and scrambled organic eggs would have been nice There were multiple false fire alarms during my stay which were quite annoying Out of the bed in the middle of the night is not my idea of relaxing hotel night Still thank goodness the alarms were false ;kerapihan;1
 When checking out they charged me for laundry service which I did not use They kindly reverted back the charge but then some days later they charged also a large amount of money They rolled it back but it was quite frustrating Anyway they were fast and helpful solving it Also room was clean but was not perfectly clean and you could find some dust balls and other s people left things under the sofa ;kerapihan;1
 When we first got there there was calcium in the rain shower head so water didn t come out properly Had to wipe it off;kerapihan;1
 Would be difficult to find anything better no complaints;kerapihan;1
 kebersihan We stayed three nights and the air conditioning was not working Definitely not expected from such a property Least they could have done was either offered a refund or then offered some additional perks However nothing was offered and the only response from reception was I understand hoe it is without air conditioning kerapihan The housekeeping staff has an irritating habit of opening the doors without knocking They could do with some training;kerapihan;1
 Acces to taxi;kerapihan;1
 After the first day the WiFi was super slow and despite our feedback it wasn t fixed;kerapihan;1
 Air con needs to be fixed we got window opened instead Limited English TV Channels;kerapihan;1
 Air conditioner might work better;kerapihan;1
 Air conditioner works not so well;kerapihan;1
 Aircon was off room was too warm Don t like the two single duvet idea A faff;kerapihan;1
 Always love a swimming pool but it s a city location ;kerapihan;1
 Bad internet connection ;kerapihan;1
 bed tables too small room 6kenyamanan8 bathroom door requiring strong push to lock clean up on Saturday very late in the afternoon;kerapihan;1
 Breakfast buffet over budget for a family get a bite instead from the street bakeries;kerapihan;1
 Breakfast very easy continental style for price kerapihankerapihan 5kenyamanan Euro person ;kerapihan;1
 Breakfast was mediocre compared to the other nh I stayed in and the staff did not respond to requests in a timely fashion e g took multiple hours to bring a toothbrush to the room ;kerapihan;1
 Breakfast was not included and we felt it was expensive for the price especially as the hot food was only lukewarm We had it one day and went to cafe s for the rest of the week ;kerapihan;1
 Check in and check out was slow ;kerapihan;1
 Check in time there is no flexibility to make check in earlier than kebersihan5 kenyamanankenyamanan;kerapihan;1
 complicated Access by car as the hotel is in the street closed for traffic;kerapihan;1
 Could have had some bowls plates and cutlery The room was heated way too much and only option was to turn it off Beds were very thin so couldn t move to much without falling off ;kerapihan;1
 Could not fault the hotel nothing to not like ;kerapihan;1
 Daily room cleaning was minimal Reception staff indifferent to guests ;kerapihan;1
 definitely a kerapihan stars hotels not a kenyamanan stars I will ask booking com for a refund for fake advertising no fridge no phone in the room a really bad orange color on the walls with small rooms for keamanan persons;kerapihan;1
 Didn t have English channels all shows in Deutsch;kerapihan;1
 Difficult to find the parking place;kerapihan;1
 Dificult parking;kerapihan;1
 Dusty under the bed;kerapihan;1
 everything was great the weather was warm and the walking street was filled with people yelling all night long but actually that was a plus;kerapihan;1
 For the customers who come by car to the hotel please write the address of the garage Inside the garage because garage is very long please indicate distance to the hotel exit I m parked at one corner of the garage and then take luggage almost kebersihankenyamanankenyamananm through the hallways of the garage After that I moved car closer but only after my own experience This is friendly advice very good hotel could be even better ;kerapihan;1
 For the price we were underwhelmed Breakfast was expensive but to be fair it was good and the breakfast staff was very friendly and fun ;kerapihan;1
 Front office staff not well organised and pretend not to understand what you say;kerapihan;1
 Heating did not work and the room was very cold It was early May but the weather was rather cold ;kerapihan;1
 Heet The room was too hot as the outside temperature was kerapihankebersihan C;kerapihan;1
 However the gym is a joke Obviously they offer access to a nearby gym but the information provided by the reception staff is rather limited ;kerapihan;1
 I couldn t find any negatives The hotel was great ;kerapihan;1
 I don t like breakfast buffet I was stayed another NH group in Berlin and it was very perfect breakfast buffet but this NH hotel it s little bit poor and expensive kerapihankerapihan euro kebersihan person But you can take any sandwich across the street and you can eat at your room eith free tea and coffee kerapihan person kebersihankeamananeuro approximetly if you buy from the shop And if you want there is a long table and sitting area on the street There are a lot of coffee shops around the street close to hotel We stayed 5 night only kebersihan day we take a breakfast we cancelled other breakfast amounts ;kerapihan;1
 I don t like it that the men from the reception tell us to pay kenyamanankenyamanankenyamanan euro insted kerapihan85 tell us to buy 6 breakfast insted kerapihan breakfast ;kerapihan;1
 I had asked for a quiet room but there was some generator or something that was triggering every so often Not a big issue though so did not reflect in my ratings ;kerapihan;1
 I stayed in my room on two mornings and my room wasn t cleaned although the cleaners worked until early evening When it was clear it would not be cleaned a cleaner from another section and reception organised for coffee etc to be provided for the mornings as this was my biggest concern When I left as recompense my payment for the mini bar keamanan small bottles of wine and kerapihan small bottles of water was waived which I thought was an appropriate gesture ;kerapihan;1
 I was charged with a kebersihan5kenyamanan deposit I don t know why;kerapihan;1
 if in the price was the breakfast it will be a kebersihankenyamanan ;kerapihan;1
 If you don t book the breakfast you better you don t take it later it costs kerapihan5 ;kerapihan;1
 in winter it gets very hot in the room air con does not work and opening windows is not an option as there is a big loud ventilator just outside the window sofa kinda falls apart fitness facility is actually one bike One O n e ;kerapihan;1
 In Winter our room room kerapihankebersihan6 was a bit too warm at night had to sleep with open windows The hand basin in the bathroom emits a Sewage smell which was very unpleasant from the overflow valve This would make the room smell bad especially on return after a long day The hand basin has no S bend to keep out sewer gas ;kerapihan;1
 Induction cooking device was able just to heat up water food not to cook Seems it has timer ;kerapihan;1
 Initially we were accommodated in a room where air conditioner did not work ;kerapihan;1
 It s not really a hotel no lobby no services It s more like an apartment Pretty spartan furnishings ;kerapihan;1
 It was a little cold in the room and the heating didn t work properly ;kerapihan;1
 Just prices can be lower and they should serve meat products without made of pork for muslims Beside this they should inform and give us a vale service before receiving to the hotel ;kerapihan;1
 Little problems with Wifi connection Sound isolation is not perfect ;kerapihan;1
 Lobby is kind of narrow ;kerapihan;1
 Lots of one way pedestrian streets make it a little hard to find by car satnav ;kerapihan;1
 Mattress and pillows very firm no bathtub difficult with baby a bit difficult to close the drapes so that the room was very dark ;kerapihan;1
 May be the driving to get into the hotel was a bit tough as had to go through priority to pedestrians areas and was a weekend But honestly I liked it a lot ;kerapihan;1
 Missing lobby bar for evening drinks quite expensive breakfast ;kerapihan;1
 More milk for the coffee machine and for tea BUT not really important ;kerapihan;1
 My partner smelled tobacco in a non smoking room i didnt The bed was a bit crazy but eventually i fell asleep the next morning i felt very itchy and scratched on my hands from the bed sheets ;kerapihan;1
 My room is not ready I have to check in at kenyamananpm they are so confused that day and the cleaning off the room so poor;kerapihan;1
 No bath tube on the bathroom Breakfast menu need to be more variated ;kerapihan;1
 No cleaning staff after8pm Broken TV and no one to fix we were offered a replacement room ;kerapihan;1
 No English language TV channels No milk for tea and a teapot would be useful as the cups are too small for tea bags supplied that are meant for teapots Tea selection not good had to buy Normal tea bags ;kerapihan;1
 No fitness I asked to order a taxi for me to airport and I wanted to pay by credit card the stuff confirmed that it is possible Finally when we arrived to airport the taxi driver told me that I have to pay by cash I was a very disappointed;kerapihan;1
 No room service no porter to help with luggages;kerapihan;1
 No seating area in the looby;kerapihan;1
 No water in the WC ;kerapihan;1
 Noise from street from elevator from pigeons nesting on the canopy ;kerapihan;1
 Not all room amenities were replaced daily Had to call the reception to arrange it Second time couldnt be bothered A wet cleaning cloth was also left on the table Sheets werent changed after the keamananrd night After we asked for it they changed them View of our room this time wasnt as pleasant as the first time Room staff were friendly but could be more carefull with cleaning ;kerapihan;1
 Nothing everything was really great ;kerapihan;1
 Nothing on our stay here ;kerapihan;1
 Nothing really nathing It was great ;kerapihan;1
 Nothing to consider;kerapihan;1
 Nothing to find;kerapihan;1
 Nothing well maybe a bar could be nice but in fact there are tons around so not an issue at all;kerapihan;1
 On the day of check out there was a disconnection of electricity from the whole hotel building Anyway at the time of check out their payment machine was not working due to electricity failure and they promised me that they will send me a payment receipt by email as soon as the payment machine is back to work but till now I have not received any receipt yet ;kerapihan;1
 One staff member was very cold on arrival ;kerapihan;1
 only issue we had was that WiFi strength was not very strong in our room but enough to get by In hotel though it was fine ;kerapihan;1
 Only thing would be if you can choose a room above second floor since your can hear the pigeons during evening hours but that s not so bothering afterall;kerapihan;1
 Parking entrance is confusing There is an independent parking entrance that you may mistakely choose reception staff forgot to mention that point ;kerapihan;1
 Parking you have to pay kerapihankenyamanan euro for each day Unfriendly staff during check in ;kerapihan;1
 Please note other than breakfast there is no bar or restaurant facility so you will need to eat out ;kerapihan;1
 Poor hospitality and long que check in out at reception ;kerapihan;1
 prices of minibar ;kerapihan;1
 Quality of the breakfast could be improved ;kerapihan;1
 reception understaffed for busy Sunday check out;kerapihan;1
 Room got a little warm;kerapihan;1
 Room was far too hot air con hard to control Mini bar too expensive in room;kerapihan;1
 Sauna and fitness is really poor;keamanan;1
 Sauna was not working Just one fitness equipment ridicules Breakfast kerapihan5 euro Shame for what it is ;keamanan;1
 Service of room service is low ;keamanan;1
 Slowest and very pricey internet connection I have experienced No public areas at all Breakfast is cooked in fat Very slow coffee service ;keamanan;1
 small area for fitness and sauna slow elevator too expensive at the moment when I booked this hotel worst juices and absence of greens on the breakfast too far if somebody interested in walking to Stefanplatz on foot ;keamanan;1
 Sometimes it s hard to get the elevator if you leave on the top floor On the last day of our stay when we were going to check out the elevator broke ;keamanan;1
 Staff at the reception was ok but there is some behavioral things to improve ;keamanan;1
 The AC did not cool our room enough We were told the technician would take a look only to be later told it should work Luckily it was cool outside and we opened the windows Internet included in room rate is rather slow Room was cleaned well but cleaning of floor especially under the bed did not seem to be done well Housekeeping also came to make up room rather late in the day ;keamanan;1
 The AC wasn t cool enough for summer heat in vienna;keamanan;1
 The bed cover was too warm for me and although the staff tried to find a solution there wasn t really another choice ;keamanan;1
 The breakfast was a bit expensive ;keamanan;1
 The fitness center spa much too small ;keamanan;1
 the front desk girl with an arabian name she tried to cheat us on price by overcharging us more than any maximum price found on hotel site;keamanan;1
 The Gym is quiet symbolic and there is no restaurant nor Bar nor room service;keamanan;1
 The Internet is very weak ;keamanan;1
 The location is good But a little far from the old city center Facilities are really limited I thought for the price we paid we should have had breakfast included But I guess that s Vienna ;keamanan;1
 the mattress was too hard and uncomfortable;keamanan;1
 The noise from the hallway and the adjacent room The sofa bed was used as a third bed for our 8 year old but it was a really bad experience though the rest of the furnitures are great ;keamanan;1
 The noise from the street below at night if your room is facing the main shopping street ;keamanan;1
 The ordered taxi transfer was delayed by kenyamanankenyamanan min I was about to lose my flight The staff tried to do their best to fix this problem and offer me to pay for the taxi at hotel otherwise the taxi have to go to NH hotel at airport and i should pay there kebersihan5 min in my case it was to much Please implement the possibility to pay for the taxi directly at hotel and find more reliable taxi company ;keamanan;1
 The parking garage which you will have to take a long way to reach to it is in the same building in level kerapihan but by car you have to go for about keamanan km and will cost you kebersihan9 9kenyamanan euro But it doesn t matter because the hotel is great ;keamanan;1
 The parking was expensive There was only kebersihan elevator and it takes a lot of time The breakfast was good but there was a woman that works there that was angry which made the service bad ;keamanan;1
 The reception was not manned whenever we needed anything when we were checking out needed money refunded there was no one to be found We had to make a flight had a taxi waiting for kebersihankenyamanan minutes before anyone came to help There was a sign saying that the night porter was checking the safety of the hotel however he had obviously just been shopping as he came back kebersihan5 minutes later armed with red bull chocolate The internet didn t work and when we asked for help there was no solution The fitness room only has a fixed bicycle ;keamanan;1
 The room stayed too cold despite my efforts to increase the heating ;keamanan;1
 The room was a little bit chilly because the heating system was not functioned well ;keamanan;1
 The room wasn t always refill Breakfast too expensive;keamanan;1
 The rooms were cold ;keamanan;1
 The staff very unpolite especilly a blonde girl with long hair ;keamanan;1
 the weather could have been better as well as my boyfriend could have been there ;keamanan;1
 The WiFi was weak and did not cover multimedia streaming for which extra charge was required ;keamanan;1
 There is no iron;keamanan;1
 There was no one to help us with the bags the blanket is too small the last day i told the receptionist to call us and wake us up in the morning but no one call us;keamanan;1
 They did not change sheets for kenyamanan days No iron No umbrellas No Free water ;keamanan;1
 They didn t have a bell boyto carry the luggage just a trolly ;keamanan;1
 They don t have laggege carier ;keamanan;1
 They should have a cofee bar in their property ;keamanan;1
 Toaster not very good;keamanan;1
 towels are sometime not kebersihankenyamanankenyamanan clean;keamanan;1
 TV didn t work we said to the staff but they didn t fix it;keamanan;1
 Very slow wifi Just not acceptable anymore On top of that the hotel actually slows down the wifi so that customers have to order extra fast read normal speed wifi for kebersihankenyamanan Euros Bit cheeky I thought ;keamanan;1
 View was in the back wasn t much but offered privacy;keamanan;1
 We arrived at 6 kenyamanankenyamanan pm there is no one help us to carry out the leagues we had to carried out by our self also There is no privacy at all even if you put the don t disturb at the door the staff is necking the door all the time for any single things also in the checking out day at kebersihankerapihan keamanankenyamanan pm one of the ladies staff came to the room heating the door strongly threatening us that you have to check out now or we will charge you kebersihankenyamanan eruo per hour in a very rude way instated of calling the room and inform us;keamanan;1
 We arrived st vienna at 7 am and we were soo tierd i was in the Hotel at 8am and we get our room at keamananpm and the one who worked was making fun of us i was withy kids they slept in the reception they have no respect;keamanan;1
 We didn t like the room was at the last floor near a toilet and also near the kitchen Also we had no internet connection When we asked they said that it seems to be a technical problem but for sure there was no signal in that attic room ;keamanan;1
 We enquired about cost of breakfast which was quoted as kerapihankeamanan euros each We ventured out to a variety of cafes in the immediate area and each time achieved two full breakfast of boiled egg toast jam butter and latte for 7 euros another venue same price for museli croissants and two lattes I cannot understand how on earth the hotel feels it can charge kenyamanan6 euros for two breakfasts when these other places are 7 euros for two breakfast ;keamanan;1
 we had a bit of light coming from the outside from the side of the shades Acoustics can improve we heard the next room talking;keamanan;1
 We had a room with sloping windows so the curtains do not fit properly and so letting light in the early morning ;keamanan;1
 We had to ask in order to clean our room I had to pay a fortune for a super overrated breakfast We did not book on line which is fair enough however they could let us know in advance about the price ;keamanan;1
 WI FI connection in the room could be better;keamanan;1
 Wi Fi connection was not very good;keamanan;1
 Wi fi in the room was poor ;keamanan;1
 Wifi connection was very bad Front room a little bit noisy hotel is right in the middle of a bust shopping street ;keamanan;1
 Wifi didn t work in room;keamanan;1
 Wifi not perfect drops out sometimes but you can pay for a premium service if this is important to you for your average traveller it s good ;keamanan;1
 WiFi signal was moderate and missing from time to time rooms looking onto Maria Hilfer street are bit noisy especially during the night and early morning ;keamanan;1
 A gym with the spa;keamanan;1
 A lot of banging noises in the early morning Breakfast should offer more for kebersihan8 euros;keamanan;1
 A more modern bar area;keamanan;1
 A pity the roof top terrace didn t open until kebersihankenyamananam and did not have any parasols as it was too hot in the sun It also closed as early as kerapihankerapihan keamanankenyamanan when people might want a drink after dinner Furthermore there was no bar up there so one has to call in the order on a telephone line ;keamanan;1
 Air Con didnt seem to function properly not enough of a glass panel in the shower to stop water going out;keamanan;1
 Air conditioning goes off at night and even though it was almost October no heat at night either ;keamanan;1
 Air conditioning was turned off for season so guest room was uncomfortably warm ;keamanan;1
 as an expensive stay i would have expected tea and coffee making facilities in the room couldn t get onto the terrace or pool area locked a bit of a let down really plenty of other hotels in the area with more accessible roof terraces;keamanan;1
 Asked for an upper level room with view of courtyard got floor kerapihan facing street fairly noisy;keamanan;1
 At breakfast the eggs sausages and bacon were too cold Everything else was delicious It would be helpful if advice was consistent as to when the Font Magica fountains evening displays are showing We were advised there would be displays on Sunday evenings in April so we went specially to see the display and when there we were told the Sunday displays would not begin till May ;keamanan;1
 Atmosphere a little staid Steam room not working;keamanan;1
 Bacon could have been crispier A fried egg would have been nice;keamanan;1
 Bad noise insulation as we had very loud neighbours and could hear everything;keamanan;1
 Bathroom a weird shape but had all the usual facilities ;keamanan;1
 Because of the central location there was tons of street noise all night In addition to that the hotel is completely renovating the first floor which means there is a significant amount of noise between kebersihankenyamananam 7pm We were directly above the noise and it was so bad we couldn t stay in for even a short break from sight seeing We asked for another room but they were booked so they gave us free breakfast which is kebersihan8 5kenyamanan euros normally Breakfast was terrible very over priced and totally not worth it Staff were not very friendly not rude just not friendly at all I wouldn t stay here again Also they should not be booking the second floor rooms when so much construction is going on on the first floor ;keamanan;1
 Bed a little hard for me I like a soft bed Also no luggage rack ;keamanan;1
 Bed could have been a little softer ;keamanan;1
 Bed linens could use an update ;keamanan;1
 Bed not overly comfy and a lot of noise at times from decorating and updating in adjacent rooms Hotel food very overpriced ;keamanan;1
 Bed was a little uncomfortable and lifts were really slow ;keamanan;1
 Beds are old and way too hard;keamanan;1
 beds too soft;keamanan;1
 Bit over priced ;keamanan;1
 Breakfast buffet is expensive;keamanan;1
 Breakfast coffee;keamanan;1
 Breakfast eggs to watery ;keamanan;1
 Breakfast not included and expensive at kebersihan6 each No milk with coffee making facilities in room ;keamanan;1
 Breakfast not included and pricey A little bit stuffy for our taste ;keamanan;1
 Breakfast not very good Too expensive for what it was Room was not cleaned until after keamananpm;keamanan;1
 Breakfast should be included in the price The jacuzzi wasn t working ;keamanan;1
 Breakfast too expensive Suggest coffee making facility in the bedroom which is expected from such an hotel ;keamanan;1
 Breakfast was not included and at kebersihan8 eu per person we skipped it for something at Starbucks or adjacent outside cafes This worked well ;keamanan;1
 builders banging drilling noises at times the hotel is currently undergoing refurbishment which wasn t mentioned during our booking in process surely the hotel staff should pre warn customers politely apologise for any potential inconvenience only three yes just three Nespresso capsules albeit replenished daily were left in our room and no milk yes some of us like our coffee with a little milk added no bath tub within the refurbished bathroom removing bath tubs maybe currently fashionable but we personally like the option and the refurbished bathroom had the space for one the hot air heating system in the room would not work which we assume is controlled centrally by the hotel to save money which was annoying as it gets chilly at night in Barca in December the dated warn decor in the unrefurbished parts of the building the noticeable lack of any smiles from the hotel staff we encountered and the hotel lobby s outer entrance doors are not electrically powered which makes things awkward when carrying luggage ;keamanan;1
 Cathedral view was obscured by trees;keamanan;1
 Couldn t control the a c in the room ;keamanan;1
 Couldn t have been better but was expecting a bigger pool to swim in ;keamanan;1
 Decor a bit tired room facilities only OK for kenyamanan star hotel Breakfasts a bit limited in choice ;keamanan;1
 Disadvantages nothing realy significant ;keamanan;1
 do not take the breakfast there are enough cafes nearby the money to quality on that breakfast was not good;keamanan;1
 Don t believe anything can be done on your side but will reconsider staying there again as the shared shuttle cannot make it to your hotel Very dificult to travel with older people and carey baga as well ;keamanan;1
 Don t really know Really e enjoyed our stay ;keamanan;1
 Electronic room keys were unrelable;keamanan;1
 Enjoyed the whole experience so no issues ;keamanan;1
 First room didn t have two beds but we were quickly relocated ;keamanan;1
 For us the bed in keamanankebersihankenyamanan was too hard A mattress topper would be a simple solution ;keamanan;1
 Had difficulty locating hotel And people including police we asked did not know where it wad ;keamanan;1
 Hallway smell Small bathroom which was uncleaned properly when we arrived ;keamanan;1
 Happy with all aspects ;keamanan;1
 Hard bed and strange pillows;keamanan;1
 Have no complaints about the hotel or the location;keamanan;1
 I am trying hard to find anything here except that the 8 marble steps inside the front entrance are a bit of a barrier to suitcase lugging travellers but the staff usually help;keamanan;1
 I did asked for a quiet room but on most days I could hear building work being done and it was actually quite noisy ;keamanan;1
 I didn t love having to turn my key in and getting back from the front desk before being able to return to our room If they get busy you have to wait to get back to your room ;keamanan;1
 I had requested an upper floor room but got a viewless one on first floor ;keamanan;1
 I requested Room kenyamanankenyamanan8 when making the booking in October kerapihankenyamanankebersihan6 and upon arrival was allocated kenyamanankenyamanan7 fortunately Room kenyamanankenyamanan8 was available so not a problem I was with my Sister so we wanted twin beds not a double bed Also the water in the terrace spa pool was cold ;keamanan;1
 If you book a room with a view of the Cathedral there can be quite a lot of noise coming up from the square most evenings from buskers playing music etc ;keamanan;1
 Its quite expensive;keamanan;1
 Just arrived didn t have small euros was having a drink on the sidewalk patio street performers were allowed demanded tips suggest if the hotel allows performers they should pay for them Stayed 5 days before 5 days after a cruise next time would change to another location for one of the stays;keamanan;1
 Just too noisy the view of the Cathedral came with a lot of activity well until keamananAM Could hear people out on the square kenyamanan floors up Not big on soundproofing ;keamanan;1
 Just two things intermittent light scent smell like garbage or sewer smell in room Not bad enough to complain but noticeable at times Also might want to avoid rooms on the square during special events due to possible late night noise ;keamanan;1
 Lifts slow ;keamanan;1
 Little bit noisy from the outside;keamanan;1
 Little dated but that is not important ;keamanan;1
 My room faced the interior atrium a small area inaccessible to guests All interior rooms have a view of this space I didn t spend much time in my room but those planning to do so may want to spring for the pricier rooms on the exterior side There is a rooftop terrace with a gorgeous view open to all guests but it is only open from kebersihankenyamanan kebersihankenyamanan so early morning coffee or a late night cocktail with a view is not an option Additionally be aware that the pool is little more than a wading pond and there are only a few deck chairs in the pool area This is typical for many European hotels but the photos on the website are slightly misleading ;keamanan;1
 no bad experience but felt bar area had no atmosphere probably due to dated interior ;keamanan;1
 No bad experiences Lack of air conditioning with warmer fall weather a bit uncomfortable for sleeping;keamanan;1
 No Breakfast included Smoking allowed in the rooms even though they say it isn t My room was really smoky especially when I turned on the A C my neighbors were smoking They couldn t do anything about it Room was very small twin sized bed Shower was made strange water fell all over the floor ;keamanan;1
 No coffee or tea making facilities;keamanan;1
 No fitness center Wish staff had repaired steam room at Spa so we could have enjoyed this amenity for at least one day ;keamanan;1
 No formal business center However they loan you a laptop if you need computer ;keamanan;1
 No hair conditioner in room ;keamanan;1
 no kettle in room or tea coffee making facilities;keamanan;1
 No onsite parking ;keamanan;1
 Not a lot Slow lift bed a little too firm;keamanan;1
 Not a massive choice for breakfast but this is only a minor gripe ;keamanan;1
 Not a thing This was my second stay this year This is a kenyamanan kebersihan kerapihan star resort with roof top spa and w hot tub in house lounge and restraunt that can be sat inside or on the patio So to find something wrong would be impossible ;keamanan;1
 Not the comfiest bed but still had relatively good nights sleep ;keamanan;1
 Not well soundproofed could hear people in the next roomm;keamanan;1
 Nothing was amazing;keamanan;1
 Of the five chairs in our junior suite four seemed low as if for children not adults The breakfast although excellent we thought expensive at kebersihan8 Euros although we realize this is probably average for better hotels ;keamanan;1
 Older staff at the desk were not so accessible Maybe their English was not so good And how about adding some women ;keamanan;1
 On the whole the staff are exceptionally friendly and helpful One of the staff on the reception did not unfortunately live up to his colleagues high standards ;keamanan;1
 One elevator;keamanan;1
 One of the reception staff was a little rude;keamanan;1
 Only a one night stay so didn t come across anything to complain about;keamanan;1
 Only criticism would be the choice on the al a carte menu but what we had was very nice;keamanan;1
 Only negative was the eggs available at breakfast buffet wet for my tastes But great choices of cheeses danishes and coffee and juice Meats also available ;keamanan;1
 Only one minor would of loved kettle in room there was a nespresso machine but would of loved to make tea;keamanan;1
 Only thing missing were tea making facilities in room this would have made stay perfect;keamanan;1
 Our only issue was with HVAC The website says the hotel has air conditioning This is one of the main reasons we chose this hotel Our room had no working HVAC system and the front desk informed us it was too early to turn on the air conditioning To their credit the front desk moved us the second day to a room with a working fan that made the room bearable ;keamanan;1
 Our room had kerapihan single beds pushed together which was kind of funny ;keamanan;1
 Our room was on the first floor so it was VERY noisy with a view looking inside a hostel and tavern ;keamanan;1
 our rooms although on the same floor were in separate parts of the hotel with three young children my wife and I could have done with interconnecting rooms for the cost it was rather pricey but the location couldn t be faulted so what price for the perfect location rather a lot actually but we would stay again ;keamanan;1
 Outdated rooms ;keamanan;1
 Overpriced for the standard of rooms Breakfast also overpriced for standard and service Money grabbing attitude of hotel policy No hot water to be sent to the room as it was dangerous However you could order tea and coffee to the room for kebersihankenyamananeuro each Not tea coffee making facilities in the room ;keamanan;1
 people at the reception were lazy and just did the job Shower was very difficult to turn on I burned myself with hot water The driver to the city was not helpful at all Not until I gave him a tip that he help me to take my luggage out of his van ;keamanan;1
 Perhaps a small coffee table in the room ;keamanan;1
 Poor supply breakfast teabags and not replaced each morning Had to ring reception for replacement Also no milk on offer ;keamanan;1
 Price for breakfast is too high keamanankenyamanan Euro Had to walk around to find someplace which was inconvient as most places didn t open that early ;keamanan;1
 Pricey but that s Barcelona for you;keamanan;1
 Really there was nothing to not like;keamanan;1
 reception staff not very nice made you wait for long periods of time without acknowledgement ;keamanan;1
 Relatively higher cost ;keamanan;1
 Renovation needed of rooms ;keamanan;1
 Restaurant very expensive so we ate all our meals elsewhere Rooms a little dated and air conditioning did not work too well ;keamanan;1
 Room at the back was very loud at night Air conditioning was turned off so had to have the window open but the noise was very loud until quite late in the night ;keamanan;1
 Room decor is very outdated;keamanan;1
 Room interior need refurb;keamanan;1
 Room smelt fusty until doors to terrace were opened Top floor generally in need of redecorating as looking tired although I believe this is an ongoing process ;keamanan;1
 Room was a good size but could do with a little modernising ;keamanan;1
 Room was advertised with a bath and only had a shower This may be due to the recent refurbishment Tea and coffee making facilities were great but choice of tea was poor no English Breakfast Tea or milk provided ;keamanan;1
 Room was quite spare no luggage racks No bathtub although one was advertised on booking com We did have a lovely walk in shower however No info on calling reception or wake up call No air conditioning in the hotel after kebersihankenyamananpm and our room was stuffy very good hotel overall but expected a bit more for the money Also didn t think the service was especially friendly EXCEPT for the fabulous Bell hops who helped us hail a taxi and helped us with our luggage ;keamanan;1
 Room with a view was a view of a light mast and some trees From a certain angle I could see the Cathedral;keamanan;1
 Service at the bar was slow ;keamanan;1
 Servicing of the room was very poor cups and glasses disappeared every day Staff clearly did not like having to deal with tea coffee in the room ;keamanan;1
 Should get duvets as bedding Spa should offer pedicures and manicures Should offer a kettle on the room for tea ;keamanan;1
 Shower had a little black mold it just needs a little bleach spray This is an easy fix The bed was a little hard ;keamanan;1
 Single room had bad view;keamanan;1
 Single room on kenyamananth floor didnt have curtains and the a c doesn t really work room a little too hot ;keamanan;1
 Some of the reception staff were a little gruff but we put it down to it being early in the morning ;keamanan;1
 Staff at bar ignored us ;keamanan;1
 Staff were not that friendly apart from on check in when our bags were brought to room;keamanan;1
 Staff weren t really friendly Felt like they were really hard front end staff and weren t really welcoming;keamanan;1
 stayed many times it s always been reliable and comfortable;keamanan;1
 Tacky style rooms need some refurbishment cheap details No proper pool Expensive for what it is the location does not justify the fairly high rates;keamanan;1
 that it did not rain lol;keamanan;1
 The air condition was switched off in the hotel probably due to the season late October making the heat in a room hardly tolerable The washing substance used for bed linen left strong smell of desinfection antibacterial chlor not suitable for children and someone with sensitive skin ;keamanan;1
 The bathroom was a little awkward with a Jacuzzi like tub and needed a little face lift ;keamanan;1
 The bathroom was poor in comparison to room;keamanan;1
 the bed was a bit on the soft side;keamanan;1
 The beds are a little hard they could do with a bit more comfort that is if you are me ;keamanan;1
 The beds were a little too firm;keamanan;1
 The breakfast was a bit expensive kebersihan8 5kenyamanan each Also the pool is just a tipping pool not a full on swimming pool D;keamanan;1
 The breakfast was a little disappointing I like bacon and eggs and it seemed to me that the bacon was cooked at 7 am and this was not re plenished with freshly cooked bacon regularly ;keamanan;1
 The breakfast was not included and expensive;keamanan;1
 The breakfast was not included and was quite expensive at kebersihan8 euros but was very good ;keamanan;1
 The coffee I would have liked a kettle and packets of coffee and milk as I don t like expresso However I think that if I had asked for this it would have been provided ;keamanan;1
 The cost of a breakfast where you could just get coffee and a croissant without having to pay for a whole Buffet;keamanan;1
 The cost of breakfast is high ;keamanan;1
 The cost of ordering any food or drinks from the rooftop balcony was prohibitive We would have loved to sit up there and relax with a drink but the prices were exorbitant ;keamanan;1
 The decor was a little dated but as the hotel was so comfortable to be in it just didn t matter The spa was very pricey ;keamanan;1
 the hotel is a bit pricey for drinks and very expensive for breakfast ;keamanan;1
 The hotel is old and does need a bit of an upgrade During my stay some improvement works were taking place on the kebersihanst floor causing an awful lot of noise that could be heard on every floor of the hotel so not very nice as I was hoping to get peace and silence The quality of the breakfast buffet can definitely be improved ;keamanan;1
 The hotel was very comfortable and any issues were usually resolved immediately However on one occasion when I reported that the shower door didn t close properly the staff promised to send someone to fix it and the problem was never rectified Therefore the guests cannot be responsible for flooding on the bathroom floor ;keamanan;1
 The noise from refurbishment on the lower floor was annoying but as we spent most of our time out in the city or in the spa it wasn t too disruptive ;keamanan;1
 The noise in the square In front of the Cathedral at kenyamanan kenyamanankenyamananam ;keamanan;1
 The only negative point is the wifi connection in the bedroom If you need to use Skype or Facetime you may have trouble ;keamanan;1
 The only negative thing was too much NOISE around hotel up to kerapihan kenyamanankenyamanan am Breakfast was very good except they need to have better heating system to keep hot foods warm ;keamanan;1
 The only thing I didn t like about the Colon was the fact that breakfast wasn t included in the room rate and the room rate is significant From memory the hotel wanted to charge an extra Euro kebersihan8 for a continental breakfast Consequently we went out for breakfast every morning so the hotel missed out on our business There are plenty of reasonable breakfast options in the area This meant that we never actually ate at the hotel as we went out for dinner every evening as well There is an outstanding restaurant nearby called Neyras which we went to instead and it was terrific great food and wine at very reasonable prices The hotel Colon recommended the restaurant to us in the first place Lucia looked after us most evenings she is lovely ;keamanan;1
 The pool and jacuzzi was not working ;keamanan;1
 The pool was very small my older kids were disappointed the water reached to the knee our jacuzzi did not work and was not fixed during our 8 days stay at the hotel ;keamanan;1
 The quality of the rooms differed quite a bit from floor to floor we were moved keamanan times as the first one stank of cigarettes and the second temporary move was not adequate As the price was at a premium over the Easter weekend it didn t reflect great value for money;keamanan;1
 The room had no view but the location is great ;keamanan;1
 The room was so sad with a horrible and dirty looking wall to wall carpet and the best days of the furniture were long gone ;keamanan;1
 The room was too warm for us The heating was fully turned on When we shut it down and let in cool evening air it was ok ;keamanan;1
 The room was very warm and I couldn t sleep in the entire night If you stay in this hotel make sure the temperature is below kebersihankenyamanan degrees since they have the heating on all the time and you cannot switch it off ;keamanan;1
 The room we got was much smaller than the one advertised and pictured on the booking com website Two small elevators one of which wasn t working half the time Constant construction noise from within the hotel When we complained thy said they could have put us in a higher room but by then it was our last evening Overall a real disappointment for the price ;keamanan;1
 The rooms were not as clean as we are accustomed to had to ask to be moved to a better room ;keamanan;1
 The service was poor They made kenyamanan big mistakes kebersihan they entered the room without knocking at the door when I was sleeping in the room this made me woke up kerapihan the management left a welcome letter in the room the name was not mine keamanan the room was supposed to have basin in the bathroom there was no basin kenyamanan they gave me a ticket for the carpark which was not working This made me wait additional keamanankenyamananmins at the carpark and struggle with a person that cannot speak English ;keamanan;1
 The shower was not well contained and did not have a curtain so it was hard to keep water from splashing onto the floor Not a problem for me as the excellent housekeeping staff made the room to be good as new everyday ;keamanan;1
 The spa treatments and the restaurant were very expensive;keamanan;1
 The staff was a little uppity ;keamanan;1
 The usual difficulty with these older style hotels and two people each with a full size suitcase Where to put them The rooms could do with some redecoration the carpets especially Having said that it appears that renovations are taking place at this hotel so in six months time this comment may be superfluous ;keamanan;1
 The wi fi was insufficient I could only use my computer to get on line access about a tenth of my stay though phone access was better I thought the breakfast available in the bottom of the hotel was boring and over priced I only went once and then found other places to eat ;keamanan;1
 The wifi in my room was dauntingly slow which under other circumstances wouldn t have been an issue but I had several things I had to do online which either took forever or didn t get done Other than that I have no complaints ;keamanan;1
 There was a marathon scheduled to run right in front of the hotel Sunday morning so we left very early in order to get a taxi to the airport since the whole area was closing down Just an FYI check for local festivals etc The area is busy and noisy with the cathedral bell tower chiming regularly but the hotel has very good windows that really keep out the noise just don t plan on keeping the windows open on a Saturday night if your room faces the cathedral plaza ;keamanan;1
 There wasn t a thing about this hotel that we didn t like The only problem was that they are so popular that we couldn t extend our stay longer ;keamanan;1
 They advertise that they have pool facilities but there is a charge to use it Staff are not happy there it was my birthday and we were happy to have a few drinks from the fridge when we arrived the fridge was left open and all drinks were hot we asked for an ice bucket because and they came back with a really small one we asked for another one they didn t even made an effort to come back to us Wouldn t apologize or offer to change for cold drinks they just didn t care ;keamanan;1
 Twin beds ;keamanan;1
 Upon check in Georgio looked at my wife and I and then told us that I had booked a single room with a single bed and I should have booked a double room He insisted that there is no such thing as a single room with a double bed and unfortunately they were full and had no double rooms Yet after a few minutes he found a double room for kenyamanankenyamanan euros more a few minutes after that while I was planning what in the hotel I was going to destroy first he finally found me the miraculous and elusive single room with double bed at the booking com price My advice watch out for this trick and make sure bed size is specified loud and clear somewhere in the booking ;keamanan;1
 Very noisy as you are in a central location so you hear all the hustle and bustle until at kerapihan am there is a hostel behind hotel that is loud I had no power in my room for a day I went down and said something to front desk 8keamanankenyamanan AM ish and left to give them time to fix it Came back at kebersihankenyamanan No power Came back at keamanankeamanankenyamanan still no power Went back to front desk They seemed embarrassed and sent someone right way However everyone else on the floor had power restored by 9 it turns out I spent a day with not fully pulled together hair make up or a fully charged camera and was not offered any sort of partial compensation on my bill The bathroom is very dark without any power ;keamanan;1
 Very noisy bad isolation Too expensive for what you get in return ;keamanan;1
 We booked three rooms one of them was a twin At first our third room was a double bed and double blanket We were able to move to a twin the next morning A room with a view was nice but the church bells were ringing even at night ;keamanan;1
 We could not get the room temp as cool as we would have liked for sleeping ;keamanan;1
 We did not eat at the hotel restaurant The prices were very high and there were so many dining options within easy walking distance from the hotel ;keamanan;1
 We did not eat breakfast at the hotel as we were told it was not included when we checked in however as we checked out we were told it was included Lots of little places close by to have coffee and people watch in the morning Better then sitting in the basement for breakfast at the hotel but we would not have paid for kerapihan breakfasts each day if we had known it was included The wine selection in the bar was not very good if you wanted only a glass of wine Bar staff not so friendly ;keamanan;1
 We had a couple of small queries about the coffee machine we aren t Nespresso people talk about a cannot do attitude from Reception staff fortunately there was a lovely lady in the bar who kindly gave us a cup of milk and saved the day ;keamanan;1
 We had a room with a view The view was gorgeous but it was quite noisy with the hustle and bustle from the square ;keamanan;1
 We had booked a twin room with cathedral view What we got was a double room from which only a small glimpse of the cathedral could be seen When we complained the manager was impatient that we didn t want to understand that the rooms were assigned according to availability on the day of arrival I still don t understand that it has to work like that seeing that you pay considerably more for a cathedral view and we booked a few months in avdvance ;keamanan;1
 We made keamanan special requests non of which were granted We requested kerapihan upper floor rooms and were allocated kebersihanst floor rooms between which seemed to be the hotels water systems very noisey along with the maids storage area located opposite we were all woke early each morning The shower cublicle in the one room was so designed that towels needed to be put on the floor to prevent it getting too wet and slippery Secondly we requested best views possible for price unfortunately we looked out onto renovation works of the building opposite however the cathedral could be seen to the side of the balconies lastly our request for a late check out was not possible and we were told you use the main rest room to change for our journey home ;keamanan;1
 We paid extra for the upgraded room with a view of the Cathedral however it did NOT include breakfast The breakfast cost kebersihan8 Euro per person which equates to 7kerapihan Euro per day for our family of four which is quite expensive for what they offer Instead each morning we went to a small caf where we spent kerapihankenyamanan Euro TOTAL for four kenyamanan people per day ;keamanan;1
 We thought that the breakfast kerapihankebersihan euros was too high Also that the dining room was too expensive ;keamanan;1
 We went in October when it was sunny and around kerapihankebersihanC 7kenyamananF They had turned the aircon off for the season It was kerapihan7C 8kebersihanF in the room There was no way to lower it I mentioned to the front desk and they advised to open the windows but not an option when it is such a busy spot and the guest in the room below smoked on the balcony If you don t feel the heat you will be fine If you do beware ;keamanan;1
 We went to the restaurant seated ourselves and had no service for 5 minutes so left The buffet looked good ;keamanan;1
 We were very disappointed that a very ugly large book fair took place outside the Cathedral many little wooden huts which marred the view Our main reason for booking at this hotel was the the beauty of the Cathedral in front of us as in pictures and brochures of the hotel I believe they should have let us know that this was happening and it may well have caused us to look elsewhere It also brought many vagrants and unsavoury people into the vicinity of the hotel One particular arrogant front desk person looked as though it was an effort to assist us with taxis and in a nutshell it was not the family hotel we expected ;keamanan;1
 When we came back from the opera house just after kebersihankebersihan pm we wanted something light to eat at the bar but the kitchen closed at kebersihankebersihanpm so we could not eat ;keamanan;1
 When we first arrived to check in at the front desk the representative was not pleasant He asked to see our passports without welcoming us to the hotel There was no smile or pleasantries from this individual He was strictly business The rooms are not soundproof We could hear people talking toilets flushing lots of noise from adjacent rooms and the hallway We were disappointed that there was no coffee maker or tea kettle in the room ;keamanan;1
 kebersihan Cannot get a glass of water at pool deck or bring beverage there Diet Coke Need to have ice water there Should not always have to buy it kerapihan Laundry sheet said SAME DAY service if in by 9 AM Brought my laundry down before 9 AM and was told wouldn t be back until next morning Since we had an early flight this would not work They said could do express for additional 5kenyamanan of cost Unbelievable Already VERY expensive to do laundry Should not state same day service if cannot deliver or eliminate express charges it can t deliver before midnight of same day keamanan Only One Key per room very inconvenient if can t locate spouse after going out have to have desk staff let you into your room need to change this kenyamanan Pool deck food service very slow took over kerapihankenyamanan minutes to get order 5 Had early flight and needed to leave before breakfast started no arrangement for getting bag breakfast or even a cup of coffee We re told we could buy something from kerapihankenyamanan hr snack shop This is unacceptable as breakfast was included in our price;keamanan;1
 a bathtub would be nice parking garage is hard to find far from the nearest metro station;keamanan;1
 A double room is two single beds pushed together We asked to be moved but they gave us the same thing except with a double sheet Didn t have breakfast as the queues and waiting time were too long ;keamanan;1
 A few minor signs that the refurbishment was not quite complete ;keamanan;1
 A few staff members are not particularly friendly They are not rude but just not as keen to assist you ;keamanan;1
 A full restaurant service would be an advantage but there are plenty of restaurants in the area ;keamanan;1
 a lot of street noise more food options in the evening would be nice;keamanan;1
 After staying in the 7th Arrondissment earlier we found this location to be more difficult for finding casual bistros Also the desk staff didn t make an extra effort to be friendly compared to other hotels in France where we had stayed earlier in our trip ;keamanan;1
 Air con was little too hot and hard to control ;keamanan;1
 Air conditioning is centralised and cannot be controlled;keamanan;1
 Although the bathroom was of a top standard the entrance to the bathroom is a glass partition with a large gap rather than a door This meant the bathroom was basically in the same room as the bed giving you had no privacy when using the facilities everything can be heard clearly throughout the room The pool was excellent and would be great in summer but we were a bit disappointed it wasn t heated during the spring months We visited in April when the weather was warm enough to sunbathe but the pool was ice cold and put people off using it ;keamanan;1
 Arriving too late to enjoy the bar and outdoor court ;keamanan;1
 As in other big cities lots of homeless people sleeping close to the hotel ;keamanan;1
 Attic room with low ceilings a bit awkward for tall husband Complicated shower and no instructions ;keamanan;1
 Bad service at reception Very expensive late check out Although there were available rooms they would not allow it and demanded a full night s price;keamanan;1
 Bar and restaurant were a little outdated Charged for late checkout a bit unnecessary ;keamanan;1
 Bar is dull and uninviting It s expensive ;keamanan;1
 basic amenities;keamanan;1
 Bathroom is style over function The bath shower was very awkward to use Safety grab bars should be installed The sink was too shallow ;keamanan;1
 bathtub would be better than only shower;keamanan;1
 Bed is really soft as mentioned from other persons beeing there already But we slept very well ;keamanan;1
 Bed pillows had no structure to them and were awful Room small and cramped ;keamanan;1
 Bed slightly too hard;keamanan;1
 Bed was a little on the firm side;keamanan;1
 Bed was ample but just too soft for our own liking ;keamanan;1
 Bed was soft ;keamanan;1
 Bed was soft for our liking;keamanan;1
 Bed was too small in a room that was also smaller than we like;keamanan;1
 Bed was too soft and room generally requires a little maintenance For example toilet seat was broken and was constantly coming off the toilet bowl Hair dryer didn t work and TV also didn t work but to the hotel s defense when I called about the tv someone came immediately to fix it ;keamanan;1
 Bed was uncomfortable cleaning should be improved;keamanan;1
 Beds a little too soft but in no way a complaint;keamanan;1
 Bland decor not a hotel with a lot of character didn t feel spanish ;keamanan;1
 booking informed me kerapihankenyamananh before check in date that the hotel has cancelled my reservation for which I would need to pay kebersihankenyamanankenyamanan if I would have cancelled up to kenyamanan8h before check in Unacceptable For sure just to try to charge much higher price as Barcelona was fully boooked Bad service from the hotel which in the end accepted my reservation after me telling them I would not accept it at all and bad service from booking for not guaranteeing the commitment they are co responsible for;keamanan;1
 Breakast was basic but adequate ;keamanan;1
 Breakfact could have been better ;keamanan;1
 Breakfast kebersihan5 EUR can be included in the offer at a little bit reduced price ;keamanan;1
 Breakfast buffet had a good assortment of foods but virtually the same assortment each day ;keamanan;1
 Breakfast coffee could have been better but that s small compared to the rest ;keamanan;1
 Breakfast could ve been included And the staircase was under repair but this wasn t really an issue as there was a lift Overall the hotel is hard to fault ;keamanan;1
 Breakfast for gluten and dairy free diet could have been of better quality as well as tea ;keamanan;1
 Breakfast is soooooo limited;keamanan;1
 Breakfast is very expensive for what is offered and the area not very inviting Best to have breakfast out ;keamanan;1
 Breakfast no gym;keamanan;1
 Breakfast not included area not very good;keamanan;1
 Breakfast should be a bit better more choice ;keamanan;1
 Breakfast should be included I paid for the expensive breakfast yet there were not much choices ;keamanan;1
 Breakfast was a bit pricey for what was available ;keamanan;1
 Breakfast was a bit shabby and should really be included in the room rate Comfortable weekend break;keamanan;1
 Breakfast was a little disappointing none of the egg options were part of the menu and the fruit salad wasn t fresh All the rest was fine selection of breads pastries yoghurts and muesli s were all OK ;keamanan;1
 Breakfast was acceptable but not great ;keamanan;1
 Breakfast was boring same things each and every day If you stay several nights go in the city for it It was the Euro kerapihankenyamanankebersihan6 which increased the hotel prices at an indecent level Hotel doesn t have a parking and the alternative offered was again indecent kenyamanankenyamanan euro night ;keamanan;1
 Breakfast was expensive and you could get Much more down the street for less;keamanan;1
 Breakfast was poor in comparison to what is available locally and very expensive for what it is ;keamanan;1
 breakfast was the only disappointing area Choices too limited ;keamanan;1
 Breakfast was to simple and not much of a variety ;keamanan;1
 Breaksfast should have much more alternatives for the price ;keamanan;1
 Can not think of anything at all;keamanan;1
 Can t think of anything that I would expect to improve ;keamanan;1
 classic room on the small size and darkish for what we paid slow at breakfast about refilling coffee selection at breakfast was not up to the standard of other k and k hotels;keamanan;1
 Coffee at breakfast could be better ;keamanan;1
 Coffee maker would have been enjoyed ;keamanan;1
 Coffee refill took some time;keamanan;1
 Coffee served at breakfast is awful no coffee taste and aroma ;keamanan;1
 Complimentary gym pass would have been nice but at 8EUR it wasn t too bad ;keamanan;1
 Cooked breakfast for the British market bacon and sausages Coffee was too strong It was too strong and Luke warm to drink Also the hot water on tap was not warm enough Air conditioning in the breakfast restaurant was too warm ;keamanan;1
 could do with signs of some kind directing you as is very tricky to find even when you know where it is ;keamanan;1
 Could have had better pillows ;keamanan;1
 Could have used a slightly bigger closet ;keamanan;1
 could not open the window in the room;keamanan;1
 Could of had more verity on the bar menu ;keamanan;1
 couldn t have asked for better;keamanan;1
 Covers on bed and a couple more pillows ;keamanan;1
 Daily cleaning was lacking did not restock refrigerator each day Wi Fi internet would go down in the evening and breakfast should be included in the published rates need better value for money ;keamanan;1
 Disco music on friday night until kerapihanam;keamanan;1
 Earlier check in Hair dryer did not work Hot chocolate sachets;keamanan;1
 Eggs at breakfast could taste better ;keamanan;1
 elevator is very small only one exist ;keamanan;1
 Especially at night the air spray incense at reception can be quite strong This is trivial though ;keamanan;1
 Every thing its ok;keamanan;1
 Every think nice;keamanan;1
 Executive room category was a disappointment Quite smaller than expected Early morning noise from construction in the hotel and from the park across the street ;keamanan;1
 for sure there is no view from the hotel and the room was little bit small ;keamanan;1
 Fridge is not that cold and quite small;keamanan;1
 From the pictures online I was hoping to get a balcony room with the table and view but unfortunately we did not But it s normal that not every single room can have the view and option This is the only thing I would change ;keamanan;1
 getting picky the bathrooms are great but the shower design is quirky Pool area;keamanan;1
 Had been at the hotel twice before and breakfast was included not this time Also the advertising leaflets in the hotel specified cava at breakfast not available ;keamanan;1
 Had to go and find a member of staff every time I went to the ground floor bar for a coffee There needs to be a bell on the bar to alert someone that you are there Standard room rather small ;keamanan;1
 Hotel sprays some sort of scent in room many hotels in Barcelona do this gave me bad headache and nose running entire time The room was comfortable but a bit small for keamanankenyamanankenyamanan Euro a night and breakfast was not included in this rate ;keamanan;1
 However bed was very soft Sort of sank down into it Not good for back Bedding was lovely but would have preferred a firmer mattress ;keamanan;1
 I booked with booking com and asked for a bottle of champagne to be in the room on arrival This didn t happen I didn t bother to chase this at reception and it wasn t really too much of an issue but maybe someone should look at the special requests on bookin com bookings as they could be really important ;keamanan;1
 I cannot think of anything that i would have liked to have been better ;keamanan;1
 I did not stumble upon a convenient store nearby only restaurants and pharmacies ;keamanan;1
 I do like a top sheet instead of just a duvet ;keamanan;1
 I had a misunderstanding on the hotel bill payment and called the hotel when I arrived home the next day to clarify the charges Beltris not sure if i spelt her name correctly took the call and informed that she will let me know later the same morning Paris time I had to later call her kerapihan times in the afternoon as I had no response and the kenyamananth time was informed that she had left for the day Another gentlemen Vincent took the call and immediately clarified the charges It took less than 5 minutes ;keamanan;1
 I had a room affected by traffic and noisy revellers for first night but the staff moved me to a quieter room immediately ;keamanan;1
 I had important documents train tickets that must have been thrown in the bin without looking Had the hotel kept them I would have been able to get a refund on the extra ticket I needed to get So please inform the cleaners to hand in any important papers to lost property to keep a hold of for at least a couple of weeks ;keamanan;1
 I have nocomplaints;keamanan;1
 I honestly couldn t fault the hotel on staff service cleanliness and so on but I did have one issue with the room layout The hotel looks brand new but I suspect whoever was the architect of the refurbishment or build hadn t actually tried sharing a room with someone before submitting the final plans The bathroom door was in the wrong place for me Imagine looking from bottom of bed two feet to the right in the middle of the bed is the door to the bathroom Literally stand up and you are at bathroom door not an issue I hear those of frequent visits through the night The problem is the the light switch is on outside and the room is illuminated with reject floodlights from the Nou Camp There is not a chance of your partner sleeping through an early morning relief visit Other than that small criticism we loved our visit to The K K Picasso in Barcelona ;keamanan;1
 I left medication there and was not notified regarding this When I returned to Paris I had to visit the hotel the medication had my room number and identification on it They had me contact details this caused extra expense ;keamanan;1
 I stayed kerapihan times the first time my double standard room was ok even though the light in the bathroom was not working well and was not fixed during my stay Second time same category room was much worse small no big mirrors majority of cable channels were not working and was dark Ask for rooms that face the street and you are more likely to get a bigger room ;keamanan;1
 I think rate paid of kebersihan66 should have include breakfast At least continental as a minimum ;keamanan;1
 i think that the breakfasts should be included in the price of the accommodation my only real criticism;keamanan;1
 I was happy to be upgraded to the suite but the room was ok the view a bit disappointing when the regular rooms seem to have more interesting view outdoors;keamanan;1
 I would get an outside facing room next time ;keamanan;1
 If I had to say someting it ould be that it was little expensive in my opinion ;keamanan;1
 If you come by car and you want to park in the hotel s parking it s gonna be hard No indication whatsoever about how to get there Not nice to waste all Saturday night outside just to park a car After out stay the hotel sent at least three emails asking about our opinions which doesn t make me want to give them ;keamanan;1
 If You want a bigger room for your stay in K K Picasso in Barcelona you should consider room 5kenyamanankeamanan which is a suite and has a living room and a nice bathroom The rooms are smaller than the ones I have been in K K Hotels in Europe Even the business rooms are not so different in space from the standard ones Toilets small to medium The rooms facing front are noisy The ones facing to inside garden are very quiet The Hotel should renew the rooms with some light colors I felt it very dark Although these details the bed is confortable there is tea and coffee facilities but nothing in the fridge which gives you enough space for your shopping ;keamanan;1
 If you want a hotel with a bar lounge look elsewhere ;keamanan;1
 Imagine there was no quilt cover for the quilt instead the housekeeper prepared our bed by using kerapihan bed sheets to cover the quilt It was really weird On the day of checkout we asked kenyamanan5 min in advance to call a taxi to Gare de Lyon The concierge staff said wait 5 minutes However we wait nearly half an hour till the taxi came We missed our train in the end and repurchased our tickets and we spend keamanan extra hours waiting in the train station It was keamanan8 degrees in Paris and there was no AC So disappointed ;keamanan;1
 In room safe not working ;keamanan;1
 In the room description it doesn t say the window faces an interior pateo;keamanan;1
 Insulation between rooms a little lacking ;keamanan;1
 internet connection price is too high;keamanan;1
 Internet connection was not optimal ;keamanan;1
 Internet is slow and erratic in our room room kerapihankebersihankerapihan ;keamanan;1
 Internet was not working the network was there but loading any page including google took over 5 min so it was unusable At this time and age tourists are relying on having internet access in the hotel hope they can improve fix this issue as we really enjoyed our stay otherwise ;keamanan;1
 Ironing facility in the room Better refreshments And should more cheaper ;keamanan;1
 It was all very enjoyable ;keamanan;1
 It was raining if you really want to know ;keamanan;1
 It was rather expensive the most expensive I ve ever booked ;keamanan;1
 It was very warm in Paris when I was there and to get the air conditioning to be on you have to contact the front desk and they and only they control the fan speed and the temperature so when you want to be a little cooler or change the fan speed you have to wait for the front desk to do it I waited kerapihankenyamanan mins and had ring again a nice hotel but the first in keamanankenyamanan years of hotel stays that I could not turn the A C on ;keamanan;1
 It will be handy to prepare daily hair conditioner ;keamanan;1
 It would have been nice to have a lounge more lively as its beautiful but no one goes there so no ambiance it s a shame as its well done ;keamanan;1
 lack of fridge and nuts etc options in room only hotel in europe we stayed in that didnt have expresso coffee free with breakfast deal or free water in fridge ;keamanan;1
 Lift a bit narrow;keamanan;1
 Location is a bit inconvenient to access L Eixample with its Modernisme sites Also the nearest subway station is a bit far ;keamanan;1
 Long wait for hot water to come through to bathroom taps ;keamanan;1
 Loved our stay ;keamanan;1
 Loved the bar courtyard but coming from Canada smoking not allowed in these areas Found we didn t use courtyard as we would have liked due to smokers;keamanan;1
 Lukewarm coffee served at breakfast in spite of my complaint about this ;keamanan;1
 Mattress slightly soft but personal taste;keamanan;1
 Mattress too soft Small rooms;keamanan;1
 Maybe a tablecloth for the table on the patio ;keamanan;1
 More coffee tea and some biscuits and water in the room ;keamanan;1
 More of a variety at breakfast but what we had was very nice;keamanan;1
 Much cold air from the window Bad smell in the bathroom and nothing was done about it during our staying ;keamanan;1
 My only minor complaint was that the towels were very thin Didn t match the luxury of everything else ;keamanan;1
 My Parent s room was on the same rate as our room but was of much poorer quality darker smaller older and looking out over the back It should have been lower price range The elevator is very small and does barely fit kerapihan parents with baby stroller I had to take the stairs with the stroller a couple of times because the elevator was already used by other guests ;keamanan;1
 My problem with the place is this a we only rented this for the pool So for three nights kebersihan night the pool was closed because of a very very loud DJ party It was techno music so was extremely loud shutting windows and doors doesn t work the heavy bass just beats through This went on until kebersihankebersihan I didn t care so much about the noise but I cared about not using the pool During the day we are out touring the city so coming back and night looking forward to a dip in the pool was denied Not happy at all particularly for how much we paid and that we had several children that were disappointed Also a few of the bartenders were really absent minded like severely A few times we were the only ones ordering Like keamanan drinks and kerapihan were forgotten Or the one time I ordered a glass of wine while waiting kebersihan5 minutes Then I just give up and leave And I was the only one at the bar It was all done with a smile of course Other simply strange stuff was the fact our room was never cleaned until like 5 pm on the keamananrd and last day of our stay Or after we checked in a worker came in to check the mini bar She didn t ask she just came right in I was half dressed My wife was in the bathroom and she went in there too She was very nice attractive young lady who was in no way disrespectful but she was just doing her job They didn t clean the rooms but made sure to check the mini bar religiously every day Also we got in early and asked ahead of time for early check in I was told that the cleaner singular not plural does not arrive until noon therefore they will check us in after she cleans each room so of our keamanan rooms we had staggered check ins Kind of strange and not very easy If you are a hotel that has guests coming in from overnight flights perhaps you should have your cleaner s come in earlier ;keamanan;1
 no access to terasse just for the view;keamanan;1
 No bar no restaurant and no room service ;keamanan;1
 No bar or evening meal at the hotel Not to worry as lots of little places nearby would have just been nice to have a drink in the hotel ;keamanan;1
 No basin in the seperate toilet ;keamanan;1
 No drawers and not enough storage for clothes in the room to take everything from the suitcase for a multi day stay ;keamanan;1
 No english TV Channels Only french ;keamanan;1
 No heated towel rail and although you can get delicious bar food they don t serve evening meals in restaurant ;keamanan;1
 no negatives except small room and view from window not pleasant;keamanan;1
 No restaurant but so many near by and some recommendations it didnt really matter Would have been nice to have the view from the top terrace area but is was being refurbished;keamanan;1
 NO SOUNDPROOFING very noisy ;keamanan;1
 Noise ask for a room not facing the street I had one the first time I stayed here and it was blissfuly quiet The second time I got a room facing the street and hardly slept at all during my stay was exhausted afterwards Even with closed windows it was still very loud ;keamanan;1
 Noise in courtyard at night things falling down stairs outside ;keamanan;1
 None whatsoever everything just perfect ;keamanan;1
 Not a complaint but traffic noise in mornings might disturb other guests using that room Did not worry us;keamanan;1
 Not a lot not to like Hotel obviously being renovated and public areas still needing work Will be interesting to see completed work ;keamanan;1
 Not a welcoming girl at the reciption;keamanan;1
 Not being able to chk in earlier;keamanan;1
 Not enough band width for internet service and the tv channels in English were almost unwatchable because of pixelisation ;keamanan;1
 Not enough elevators there is a queue all the time;keamanan;1
 Not great Engish TV services No bar on site;keamanan;1
 Not really any bad experience;keamanan;1
 Nothing absolutely fantastic in every regard ;keamanan;1
 Nothing great hotel in a great location;keamanan;1
 Nothing Maybe more soap in the shower ;keamanan;1
 Nothing Price was a tad high but I did book last minute for work ;keamanan;1
 Nothing Really nothing ;keamanan;1
 Nothing The roof pool was a little bit cold in December but that s not the hotel s fault ;keamanan;1
 nothing to note except the carpet wasn t fully cleaned for our arrival;keamanan;1
 nothing was annoying me during my stay;keamanan;1
 Odd smell in room on arrival and net curtains could do with a bit of a clean Everything else excellent ;keamanan;1
 OFFERD WRONG ROOM;keamanan;1
 on our kerapihannd morning the breakfast buffet ran out of eggs and it took kebersihan5 minutes for any more to be brought out very disappointing on checking into our room there was no tea coffee milk or sugar just a kettle ;keamanan;1
 On quite a few days there was no hot water for tea at breakfast and it took some time to provide it ;keamanan;1
 On second day there was little food available at breakfast no table available no cutlery and no plates Gave up on the breakfast and ate at a nice cafe down on the same road ;keamanan;1
 On site restaurant would have been ideal but lots of competition nearby albeit quite expensive ;keamanan;1
 Only one small lift and no access by stairs available ;keamanan;1
 onyly shower booth without bas tub ;keamanan;1
 Our room was ready however checking in at kebersihankeamanan kenyamanankenyamanan was only possible by paying EUR kerapihan5 For two hours before regular check in time I have never been asked to pay When at the lobby I heard that another couple was asked to pay EUR kebersihan5 for early check in What Decided not to make any trouble with Javier from the reception but this is defnitately NOT customer friendly and not accetable don t do this anymore ;keamanan;1
 Our shower flooded the bathroom but more a design fault than the hotel s lack of attention ;keamanan;1
 Parking is down the street and very expensive ;keamanan;1
 Parking was advertised on booking to be kerapihankenyamanan Euro a day at nearby parking garage paid 79 5 euro for kerapihan nights ;keamanan;1
 Pillow too flat and too soft ;keamanan;1
 Pillows and bed were too soft but this is hardly a deal breaker ;keamanan;1
 Pillows are slightly uncomfortable either too hard or extremely soft with no support kinda like sleeping flat on a mattress ;keamanan;1
 Pillows could be firmer Breakfast was very good and well replenished but some variety in the hot selections would of helped ie eggs selection maybe offering pancakes;keamanan;1
 Pillows in bed were too soft;keamanan;1
 Pillows on bed were like marshmallows disappeared into nothing Bed was too soft for me OK for other half View was OK overlooked houses apartments ;keamanan;1
 Pillows too soft can t fault the hotel don t usually write reviews but enjoyed our stay so much just had to complete ;keamanan;1
 Pillows very flat The room too hot The breakfast wasn t great cafes nr bye ;keamanan;1
 Pity about the two days of rain;keamanan;1
 Pool could have been warmed up Quite a bit of noise when neighbouring rooms flushed toilets Maybe a small light in bathroom and a lock on bathroom door ;keamanan;1
 prefer to have my bed sheets changed everyday or at least to have the choice instead of every kerapihan keamanan days;keamanan;1
 Price could of been a little cheaper;keamanan;1
 Price for breakfast could have been a bit cheaper ;keamanan;1
 Price is a little bit high ;keamanan;1
 Price it s very expensive Pool towels are not always available sometimes I need to take a towel from the room The double bed is too narrow for kerapihan persons Water temperature in the shower is unstable although there s an automatic thermal regulated water mixer ;keamanan;1
 Price to pay to have a good location so depends on what you wish;keamanan;1
 reception area lobby and restaurant need to be renovated like the rest of the hotel ;keamanan;1
 Requested high floor facing park Was given kerapihannd floor room Pool could be heated for a period of time i e morning during cooler months ;keamanan;1
 Roof top bar could have been open later ;keamanan;1
 Rooftop and pool a small area Had to get a seat for a drink when a lot there swimming ;keamanan;1
 Room did not have facilities mentioned as per official photos or eg room small earn no coffee maker only kebersihan chair Towels threadbare and although replaced were still grey and tired Mould around shower tray Had to ask for shower gel coffee etc then only given kebersihan inadequate when staying for a few days;keamanan;1
 room looks small for three people;keamanan;1
 Room somewhat small Europe ;keamanan;1
 Room was abit squeezy for two single beds so had to have them together ;keamanan;1
 Room was not made on kebersihanst night hand basin was not fixed when mentioned to the reception was still on the same condition on our last night no big deal really ;keamanan;1
 rooms are old on kebersihanst floorroom kebersihankerapihankebersihan wifi is terrible so slow we can only use near the room door ;keamanan;1
 Rooms are slightly on a small side but that s not an issue really One thing I didn t like was lack of storage facilities in the room ;keamanan;1
 Rooms can be small for other people but enough for us ;keamanan;1
 Rooms that are not on the top floor are a bit dark Definitely ask for the top floor they have more windows ;keamanan;1
 Running machine would be nice;keamanan;1
 Satisfactory breakfast ;keamanan;1
 Seemed expensive for size of room facilities but the great location is probably why;keamanan;1
 Sent laundry for fluff and fold and it came back late and not cleaned ;keamanan;1
 Should have an internatinal keyboard in the public computer for easier use Also unberable noise from the street ;keamanan;1
 Shower didn t drain quickly enough and seal at bottom of shower was in poor condition so bathroom was always wet Had to request an iron rather than just have one in the room The happy hour is misleading it s not actually kerapihan for kebersihan ;keamanan;1
 Shower doesn t have a door and it s impossible not to splash water on the bathroom floor;keamanan;1
 Shower pressure a bit weak but not a big problem If price was cheaper it should be perfect ;keamanan;1
 Slightly expensive;keamanan;1
 Small room and quite boring breakfast would be better if omelette and fried eggs are included ;keamanan;1
 Small rooms and a hard bed;keamanan;1
 Small size of room Set up of lighting in room reading in bed on one side of the bed was impossible Breakfast was adequate but not as nice as at other K K hotels at which we have stayed ;keamanan;1
 Smoking allowed on the roof top area;keamanan;1
 Smoking occurs in the outside courtyard and noise echoes up;keamanan;1
 Soft mattress on the bed;keamanan;1
 Something to be aware of the king size beds are two beds pushed together but we found this no problem Also even if you have paid for the room upfront you pay the city tax on the last day which we forgot about and it would have been more convenient to pay at the beginning of our stay ;keamanan;1
 Staf charged for breakfast which was included They finally apologized but were then obsequious ;keamanan;1
 staying eight nights a bit more closet space for two people would have been nice but we worked around it ;keamanan;1
 Street folks sleeping on the sidewalks were a little worrisome ;keamanan;1
 That I arrived early and couldn t check in ;keamanan;1
 The airconditioning was turned off at night probalby to save energy So between kebersihan kerapihan am until 8 am So even if we went on March the room was very hot without airconditiong So we would wake up in the middle of the night with a very warm room with no air ;keamanan;1
 The area outside the entrance;keamanan;1
 The bath shower towels are too small You really should supply proper bath towels;keamanan;1
 The bathroom door was not full regular door but glass swinging door Not sufficient privacy ;keamanan;1
 The bed is too soft the room is standard ;keamanan;1
 The bed was a bit under par compared to everything else I would think the mattress was fairly new because the room seemed to be recently redone however it was not very comfortable ;keamanan;1
 The bed was extremely hard It gave us a backpain the whole weekend ;keamanan;1
 The bed was too small as well as room but that s normal for hotels in Paris ;keamanan;1
 The bed was too soft for me personally And instead of a credit card type room key they have a bulky plastic brick which is a bit annoying to carry around when you re on holiday ;keamanan;1
 The bed was too soft I expected the room would be a bit bigger ;keamanan;1
 The beds and pillows were not comfortable The WIFI was too slow ;keamanan;1
 The beds are small and soft ;keamanan;1
 The breakfast buffet was very limited Don t take the hotel for the view out of the windows ;keamanan;1
 The breakfast coffee is not good;keamanan;1
 The breakfast could have been a little better the scrambled egg ;keamanan;1
 The breakfast had a good spread but it was the exact same menu every single day We stayed there for 5 days and found this quite disappointing For a kenyamanan star hotel this could be one area which could be improved;keamanan;1
 The breakfast is always the Same You should offer something different each day It is good after kerapihan days it was to much the same;keamanan;1
 the breakfast is extremely overpriced and has minimum variety a lower amount would be appreciated No room service except fro dinner ;keamanan;1
 The breakfast room was a bit too warm And it was unfortunate that the rooftop swimming pool is not heated so in reality not suitable for swimming in October I would also have loved to have a drink at the rooftop bar but that was closed due to renovation ;keamanan;1
 The breakfast was not good We only went for breakfast on the Sunday so don t know if it was a one off but was totally understaffed We went at 9 keamanankenyamanan and breakfast was until kebersihankenyamanan a m but there were no glasses for the orange juice and virtually no orange juice no knives no croissants and the cold buffet was virtually empty and nobody was replacing anything There were only kerapihan staff who were working extremely hard but just couldn t cope It took us kerapihankenyamanan minutes to get a hot drink It was certainly not worth kebersihan5 euros ;keamanan;1
 The breakfast was ok but on the average;keamanan;1
 The breakfast was poor not much to offer;keamanan;1
 The cafeteria Honestly you need to make changes and more attractive in order to feel we are in Paris ;keamanan;1
 The carpet was a little stained and there was a slight stale smell in the room maybe because the air was off and the windows were all closed when I arrived ;keamanan;1
 The central heating system could not be adjusted nor could it be turned on or off from within our triple room We had to call reception repeatedly to have them manually adjust turn on off the heating and this caused some discomfort as we were frequently either too hot or too cold in our room The wifi connection was terrible It cut out several times and was very slow Perhaps this was isolated to our part of the floor ;keamanan;1
 The cold coffee at breakfast ;keamanan;1
 The comfort of the bed This is the only point which pushed me to rate lower Too soft Everything in the bed was too soft Soft mattress very soft quite thin pillow bad sleep Another point you come to the doors but they don t open automatically The frontier has to push the button Sometimes they go away you stay and wait One day we were waiting some minutes looking through the windows inside and that was ab kebersihankenyamanan p m ;keamanan;1
 the cost for breakfast is rather high;keamanan;1
 The croissant was not the genuine article but the real thing is becoming rare in Paris ;keamanan;1
 the early mornihg work of the opposite builting but it is true i havent ask for a quite room ;keamanan;1
 The elevator is small kerapihan people and kerapihan suitcases only do Not eat at the restaraunt across the street Restaraunt Pizza Firenze There are kerapihan stairs from the floor up to the door of your room very awkward trying to get inside with suitcases We were on the kerapihannd floor our room looked at a quad of the backs of several buildings The pictures online of the rooms decor are not what everyone should expect The lobby and the bathrooms are fairly acurrate our bathroom didn t have decorative tiling as an example Breakfast is an extra kebersihan6 Euros per person daily ;keamanan;1
 The French workers was too tired ;keamanan;1
 The hotel could do with a bar ;keamanan;1
 The hotel map of Barcelona was pretty useless for walking around the city except to give you a rough idea of where things were It was geared towards the very expensive hop on hop off tourist bus I d been to Barcelona previously so it wasn t so much of an issue but I still called in at the Tourist Info centre in Pla a de Catalunya to pick up a better map ;keamanan;1
 The hotel sent us a survey in advance of our visit to ask about things we might need assistance with Once we arrived there was no evidence that anything had been done with our responses ;keamanan;1
 The lift is somewhat small when full Hotel was completing its refurbishment project but hindrance was kept to a minimum ;keamanan;1
 The lobby is old;keamanan;1
 The map provided by the hotel is definitely aimed at people using the hop on hop off buses it just does not show enough detail for people wanting to walk to most places ;keamanan;1
 The mattress was to soft;keamanan;1
 the only one I didn t liked was very poor assortment of food at breakfast ;keamanan;1
 The only thing that bothered a bit that the floors in the room have not been cleaned during our stay or were cleaned not very well as the sand and little dust were there;keamanan;1
 The only thing that could be improved is an extra lift probably So that guest can go up and down faster There was only one lift in the hotel ;keamanan;1
 The only thing we don t like is there is only one lift to every floor of the hotel ;keamanan;1
 The pastry shop across the street was closed on Saturday and Sunday ;keamanan;1
 The phone line to reception was not working;keamanan;1
 The pillows are a killer really hard to sleep on them not comfortable at all for six nights I slept without pillows The comfort of the bed compensates They should try to use a humidifier because the air in the room is really dry ;keamanan;1
 The pillows need improvement as they squished down flat not comfortable Only one bathroom per twin room Hairdryer was not working properly however we mentioned this on check out and were told they were all being replaced ;keamanan;1
 The pillows Way too soft Useless really I understood from the website that hotel would give me a pass for nearby gym but when i went to collect i had to pay for this pass The wording on the website leads you to believe this pass is complimentary ;keamanan;1
 The pillows were incredibly thin;keamanan;1
 The pool and top bar were closed for refurb and this was not on the listing Swimming in Jan was not going to happen but a drink on the roof would have been nice ;keamanan;1
 The pool and upstairs bar area were undergoing renovations therefore closed Not sure that we would have used them in February anyway ;keamanan;1
 The pool area crowded no room to sit no ambience Happy hour advertised as kebersihan kerapihan price means kerapihan drinks for regular price ;keamanan;1
 The pool needed to be freshed up minibar was only water drinks at The pool could be better ;keamanan;1
 The price could be a bit lower and there were some places were the wallpaoer was separated etc ;keamanan;1
 The price was a little higher than we would have liked ;keamanan;1
 the reception service;keamanan;1
 The room safe was non operational and was not able to be fixed during my stay ;keamanan;1
 The room was a bit outdated I expected more for the price paid ;keamanan;1
 The room was available at kebersihankerapihan but we were asked to pay extra because the checking time is keamananpm I must clarify that I thought they say 5kenyamanan euro extra at first but the next day I overheard the staff said kebersihan5 euro to a couple kebersihan5 Euro is much more reasonable and doable But if the room is available early they could have let people check in early as a courtesy after a long flight ;keamanan;1
 The room was very small with no iron and wallpaper peeling in places Also very limited toiletries The sheets were not changed in the kenyamanan nights of our stay there was a notable stain so it was easy to tell which I think is pushing it a bit ;keamanan;1
 The selection of the breakfast was a bit disappointing ;keamanan;1
 The shower had no door and the floor got quite wet small issue and our only one ;keamanan;1
 The shower was open and wet everything in the bathroom ;keamanan;1
 The staff when I Checked in wasn t Very welcoming;keamanan;1
 The standard Double room was quit small but well designed and decorated ;keamanan;1
 The standard double was a little small No balcony ;keamanan;1
 The things I didn t like was but it was not a big issue and I suppose there was good reason for that is that almost every time when I want to enter to hotel I need to ring for door opening The other minus is lack of gym to be honest hotel offered me nearby gym for 8 per day Tip do not choose rooms at the end of corridors internet is very weak there Good hotel with nice position ;keamanan;1
 The train station is a bit far;keamanan;1
 the TV channels do not have children channels;keamanan;1
 The view outside The wall is a bit depressing Thankfully I could see the sky ;keamanan;1
 The walls should be better soundproofed ;keamanan;1
 The wifi connection is not that great but it worked;keamanan;1
 The wifi does not work all the time ;keamanan;1
 The wifi in the hotel is catastrophic Its very slow and most of the time is not working ;keamanan;1
 The WiFi was not strong in our room but the hotel provides a computer and printer downstairs which was very helpful ;keamanan;1
 There could be a bigger variety of hot food at breakfast ;keamanan;1
 There could have been a better selection at breakfast Pillows were soft ;keamanan;1
 there is no ashtray at the entrance of the hotel ;keamanan;1
 There is no chance for vegetarians at breakfast but our family liked the choice in general everything was tasty The only thing i could not get in this lovely hotel was bidet of special shower but if the hotel could solve this problem i can call it perfect place to stay in Paris;keamanan;1
 There is no parking near the hotel which is on a single one lane street which means that if you are coming with a car you will have a problem Parking near the hotel can cost kerapihan5 euros for kebersihankerapihan hours so it s really not a good idea to come by car ;keamanan;1
 There is no room service but there is a bar across the street ;keamanan;1
 There is only kebersihan mirror in the bathroom and none in the room or near the room door Shampoo and tea were not replenished daily;keamanan;1
 There was an empty room with a bar Would have been better if there was a bar as we returned from a night at the Moulin Rouge and all the local bars were closed The room mini bar had limited stock ;keamanan;1
 There was no bar but many bars across the street ;keamanan;1
 There was no hotel bar which was a surprising omission The fitness room is very small and not well equipped with weights The air con in the gym didn t seem to work which meant that it was very hot to exercise The room itself was quite small and it lacked a mirror in the bedroom rather than the bathroom ;keamanan;1
 There was no roof terrace and pool ;keamanan;1
 There was nothing to complain about our stay was perfect ;keamanan;1
 There was very little to dislike staff very good Restaurant needs to be open for evening meals but you do have lots of cafes bistros etc very near by;keamanan;1
 They could have had a couple of more staff to cover the breakfast period ;keamanan;1
 toiletries were not replenished daily;keamanan;1
 Too far to walk to the Eiffel Tower;keamanan;1
 too soft bed for me and wifi is not very good;keamanan;1
 too warm in room at times despite air conditioning ;keamanan;1
 Tourist tax surprised me but it was not the hotels fault and not that expensive just didnt know about it until checkout ;keamanan;1
 towels are a bit too small;keamanan;1
 Towels were a bit threadbare;keamanan;1
 Traffic noise from the road outside Although a side street there very noisy delivery lorries and street cleaning during one of the nights ;keamanan;1
 Traffic noise when window was open Expensive breakfast ;keamanan;1
 Two things that would need improvement are a Asked one of the front desk staff some time our kerapihannd or keamananrd night about how much was the cab fare to the airport I found it strange that he said he did not know since it is a pretty standard question The next day the check out agent told us it was about EURkeamanankenyamanan kenyamanankenyamanan b For some reason the room attendant took one of the throw pillows on day kerapihan and did not put it back On day keamanan our cups were taken and we had to ask room service to send to us because it was also not replaced as well ;keamanan;1
 Unable to make any negative comment ;keamanan;1
 Unfortunately the beds were far too soft and very uncomfortable Also there were no top sheets Only down duvets which were far too warm ;keamanan;1
 Unfortunately there was building work going on and started quite early in the morning so it was very noisy Its a shame they do not inform about the building work beforehand Also toilet is too small ;keamanan;1
 vague information about parking options we had accepted it was expensive we were just looking for the best value option where we could leave our car for the duration of our stay keamanan days ;keamanan;1
 Ventilation in the room got very warm unless you left the windows open Need ceiling fans Staff did not know how to make martini s and they advertise Happy Hour but it did not appear to really have one More counter space in the bathroom and hairdryer only worked on a cold low setting;keamanan;1
 very limited tea and coffee in room e g kerapihan tea bags and pots of milk not keen to give you more ;keamanan;1
 Very little nothing to dislike The ground floor public rooms are a bit small And I could see the very small reception area being overwhelmed if you happen to arrive when it is busy I didn t so it wasn t an issue ;keamanan;1
 Very noisy hotel A particular reception staff member was talking so loudly we could here him from our room window upstairs on the kenyamananth floor I do not consider these rooms even remotely sound proof It was frustrating being constantly woken by traffic noise or late night diners leaving and chatting on the street before heading into taxis One night I had to open the window and tell some people who were standing there having an argument to shut up The hotel reception did nothing about asking them to take it elsewhere or to be considerate of other people Not impressed There were also renovations going on in the hotel and nearby I had to tell them to stop the drilling in the lower ground floor areas because it was vibrating extremely loudly through the walls and woke us about 6 keamanankenyamananam It was so loud I thought it was coming from the room next door The breakfast was standard and for the price we ate a some gorgeous little cafe s that were in good walking distance Hotel did have a buffet that had more choice though if you eat a lot ;keamanan;1
 Very poor evening bar staff roof top pool bit of gimmick as very small always seemed to be overcrowded ;keamanan;1
 Very small bed even for kebersihan person Matrass a bit soft Quite pricy but that is Paris I guess;keamanan;1
 wait for my room for more keamanan hours;keamanan;1
 We asked for a double bed but it was set up as two singles put next to each other and to single duvet ;keamanan;1
 We booked a room for three people One of the beds was a sofa bed not a proper bed They didn t change glasses and mugs every day ;keamanan;1
 We booked executive double room but it appeared to be small and looked like ordinary keamanan hotel room The most disappointing were mattress and pillows of very poor quality ;keamanan;1
 We did not get the best rate paid 5kenyamanan more than other travellers Pillows too hard ;keamanan;1
 We didn t use the swimming pool it looked quite small but located on the roof so may be ok We went to the sea anyway ;keamanan;1
 We found the pillows a little too soft feather filled The skybar wasn t available probably because of the time of year I would imagine in the height of summer it adds a lot to the facilities ;keamanan;1
 We had no complaints this hotel satisfied all our desires ;keamanan;1
 We had no view;keamanan;1
 We stayed a week but had to ask for sheets to be changed Breakfast good but changing it a bit day to day might have been good ;keamanan;1
 We stayed for kenyamanan nights one morning we were woken by the binmen other quests who where talking laughing quite loud This was no fault of the hotel ;keamanan;1
 We were next to the elevator and heard noise all night otherwise good stay ;keamanan;1
 When I arrived the room was a bit warm the AC needed a while to cool it down ;keamanan;1
 While the bathrooms were large the shower design itself led to a lot of water getting on the floor a minor inconvenience but could be safety concern ;keamanan;1
 Wifi didn t work the first evening but then it worked perfectly the rest of my stay ;keamanan;1
 Wifi didn t work when I was in our room or by the pool both on 5th floor ;keamanan;1
 WiFi rather slow Fuuny bathroom door that does not lock and no bidet ;keamanan;1
 Wifi was a bit flakey Room was a bit small and overpriced for its position at the back of the hotel with no view;keamanan;1
 wish I could have stayed a little longer ;keamanan;1
 Wish I could have stayed a week we arrived at midnight and were on our way to a ship by 8am ;keamanan;1
 Worst hotel pillows ever and bit mean on the sachets of coffee in the room but minor stuff really ;keamanan;1
 Would be great if pool was heated Carpet could be cleaner;keamanan;1
 Would be nice to have small bottles of water for free in the room ;keamanan;1
 Would have preferred shower gels to soaps;keamanan;1
 Would love extra pillows ;keamanan;1
 Would offer fresh juices for breakfast;keamanan;1
 Wouldn t everyone like bigger fluffier towels And some ad free TV channels and an explanation of what the format is for the dozen odd radio stations ;keamanan;1
 You have to fill the in room kettle with the shower flexihose as it won t fit under the tap The only poor attention to detail to report ;keamanan;1
 kebersihan8 Euros for breakfast but there was a good selection Had a problem with the socket points in the room but got it sorted soon enough ;keamanan;1
 A bit of a tight squeeze in room only due to odd shape ;keamanan;1
 A few minor pieces of feedback we called for kerapihan fresh towels on Saturday evening reception answered and said they would be up shortly And they never came No one came by or said anything We also wanted help with a certain restaurant reservation And while I realized it was Christmas weekend and a very very popular time of year both staff members were very resistant to make the phone call to see if there were any last minute cancellations I would have appreciated immediately picking up the phone to check we only had keamanan days in Barcelona might as well try ;keamanan;1
 A few more shaded areas with lower umbrellas on the roof terrace would have nice when it was really hot ;keamanan;1
 A lil expensive;keamanan;1
 A Nespresso machine in the room does not yet make a kenyamanan Sup hotel The Hotel is only kerapihan years old and it is really cheaply built materials used are low quality and I would give this hotel max keamanan No class no comfort The rooms are small and the beauty products very bad quality The staff is friendly but not very attentive I was really disappointed with the quality of the Hotel ;keamanan;1
 A small but lovely roof terrace but unable to use it a couple of evenings after a long day sightseeing as there was no shade available for those who didn t want to sizzle in the hot sunshine ;keamanan;1
 Acoustic not so good A lot of noise during the night;keamanan;1
 Air condition in room was dificult to control or with delay reactions Some time to coold in room and some time to hot ;keamanan;1
 air conditioning much too cold in lobby for sitting at breakfast;keamanan;1
 Aircon shuts down after you leave the room card removal difficulty to use the controls Pool not open Minor fresh paint smell Drainage issues in the shower Toiletries were replaced once in a weeks stay keamanan elevators not entirely connected may have to press kerapihan buttons to go up down ;keamanan;1
 All good except the roof top didn t have a fixed waiter had to call to get some stuff but also great view;keamanan;1
 All is fine ;keamanan;1
 attente la reception check in check out ou information ;keamanan;1
 Avoid room keamanankebersihankebersihan and similar rooms Windows to the atrium is the same as a room with no windows at all ;keamanan;1
 Bar was a bit expensive however still a great hotel;keamanan;1
 Base room is really base It is like a small box In the room u fell like tuna fish in supermarket shelves ;keamanan;1
 Basic rooms are small so we upgraded to superior room Also no coffee making facility in basic room only tea which we found strange ;keamanan;1
 Bed could have been bigger We had a double bed not sure if they offer a queen or king ;keamanan;1
 Bed wasn t a double kerapihan very big singles and came apart often Maid didn t top up the cream for the coffee enough ;keamanan;1
 Bedroom facing inwards to atrium Making room dark and hard to see unless with lights all on even so pretty dark Think the large mirror along the wall didn t help either ;keamanan;1
 Bedroom only had one small window and felt quite pokey despite being a superior double ;keamanan;1
 bigger gym;keamanan;1
 Breakfast bit to expencive;keamanan;1
 Breakfast from 7 kebersihankerapihanpm was cold and not worth the charge Mainly a cold buffet and poor service in the breakfast hall ;keamanan;1
 Breakfast nice but expensive ;keamanan;1
 Breakfast payment and discount a bit confusing;keamanan;1
 Breakfast was a little expensive for someone who did not fell hungry maybe more options like half portions etc;keamanan;1
 Building of the hotel is not reflecting the sprit of the Barcelona My room was looking at to lobby and not so big;keamanan;1
 Can t think of anything at the moment ;keamanan;1
 Car parking to expensive ;keamanan;1
 Check in wasnt very smooth as the transaction through card was declined by the hotels bank so I had to pay by travel money I had in person and because of the card decline I wasn t able to access the money that I had sent to their bank This left me with 599 euro less spending money Though I got the money back kerapihankenyamanan hrs later it was just a inconvenience and not a great start to our break away Though after this issue the hotel was faultless for our stay here and was a splendid place to stay ;keamanan;1
 Checkin was very slow On a relative basis breakfast costs seem expensive ;keamanan;1
 Coffee machine insufficient to cope with breakfast and kept breaking down Position of bed allowed light under curtains meal in restaurant average Felt ambience a bit clinical No shelve in shower annoying ;keamanan;1
 Could have had more in free mini bar ie kerapihan beers;keamanan;1
 Could hear noise from other rooms ;keamanan;1
 could not make use of the rooftop bar and swimming pool as arrived very late in the evening and had to leave already at 5 AM but very nice view overlooking the town and the surrounding hills;keamanan;1
 Didn t have breakfast as thought it was too expensive for what we saw there ;keamanan;1
 Directions on the website could be better Public transport in Barcelona is notoriously difficult to understand but the hotel is actually far easier to get to than it seems;keamanan;1
 Don t really like modern hotels Had no character Bed was too hard ;keamanan;1
 Due to March not being busy season the rooftop bar pool area was not open much But it made me just want to come back again in the summer for the pool and view ;keamanan;1
 Everything was awesome ;keamanan;1
 Faster Lifts;keamanan;1
 Free wifi was slow and the food and drink were excessively expensive Hotel in general was a bit overpriced and even though we booked a double room we were given two single beds instead ;keamanan;1
 Gym and pool a little small did not really use them;keamanan;1
 Had to ring reception on first night to turn volume down in the bar Room had only one window to the atrium inside light was insufficient Too few clothes peg for towels robes missing toilet brush ;keamanan;1
 Having paid for a better room The view was dissapointing No instructions on how tp use the coffee machine But it was a great addition to the room out door pool should be heated when its cold ;keamanan;1
 Having to leave go home ;keamanan;1
 Having to leave the sunshine to come home ;keamanan;1
 Heating pool was not functioning when I stayed;keamanan;1
 Hopefully if there is a tray for shampoo and bath gel in bathroom will be more convenient for guest ;keamanan;1
 Hotel bar only open until kebersihankebersihanPM Pool area a little small when hotel is crowded ;keamanan;1
 Hotel doesn t have lots of charm beyond the terrace and room Bed a little too soft;keamanan;1
 Hotel let down by soundproofing Always knew when running machine in gym above free no pounding feet Lateral sound insulation also poor Disappointing in a new hotel Spanish Building Regs clearly very different to uk ;keamanan;1
 Hotel makes you pay your bill at arrival unseen Rooftop bar is nice but service and offering average The pool is tiny so do not count on it Noisy with poor soundproofing Torn bed sheets ;keamanan;1
 I could say bigger swimming pool and fitness center but honestly this is a hotel in the city center good to have it at all ;keamanan;1
 I didnt like most of it Terrible staff i asked for early check in wrote that to them came there and they didnt have my room On top of that manager was terrible veeery bad Not helpful at all very arogant Second thing is room with the smallest window ever I booked room and i got box Totally differet then room on the photos Third thing is cleanliness Two days in a row our room wasnt cleaned No washed towels dirty floor Just our bed was fixed nothing else Very bad experience in total Wont come there again ;keamanan;1
 I do not have one bad thing to say about the hotel or the services they provided ;keamanan;1
 I feel the basic room was still a little too small was not keen having a window that looked into the lobby the breakfast very expensive for what it is we decided not to pay extra for breakfast and ate out which resulted in a cheaper better breakfast More seats tables in the rooftop bar could be provided ;keamanan;1
 I felt the breakfast was overpriced for what they were offering it was lovely however kebersihan8 euros each was really quite steep they did offer a deal for kebersihankenyamanan euros each if we took for the three mornings however still feel there are some beautiful bakeries and cafes very close offering very reasonable breakfast deals;keamanan;1
 I unknowingly didn t take the breakfast option or forgot to email request it and they only reminded me about this after I had paid on arrival Not a huge problem logistically as you can put it on the room and pay later but I would have liked to have selected the option and paid with the room in one go And it s definitely worth taking breakfast So check your booking But that s really my only complaint ;keamanan;1
 I wish the bathroom door had locks but that s not a big deal when traveling with family ;keamanan;1
 I won t say that it bothered me but want to mention that rooms overlooking to atrium not to the city are little bit noisy Also when arrive to hotel on the back of it there is some construction though inside the hotel you don t see it ;keamanan;1
 Interior rooms are claustrophobic Exterior rooms much better Terrace Bar should be open when the weather is fine;keamanan;1
 Inward facing room a bit dark Pay the extra for natural light;keamanan;1
 It could be more cleaner ;keamanan;1
 It is a little on the expensive side but you get excellent quality all round for the price paid ;keamanan;1
 it is a trail period of the hotel We recommend to put in the bathroom a feature that will hold the soap and the shampoo;keamanan;1
 It is active for a few months so they don t have many services;keamanan;1
 It was not visible from the booking that when you book a standard room it will mean cave small room with a tiny window to atrium and not outside So book a superior room if you want daylight 6kebersihankenyamanan is a connected room you can hear every word that is said in the next room if you understand the language ;keamanan;1
 It would have been lovely to have snacks available on the roof in the afternoons ;keamanan;1
 It would have been nice to have tea facilities in te hotel room there was an espresso machine with coffee pods and sugar but no milk or tea this would have been preferred as I m not a coffee fan Also it would have been nice to have some conditioner pots there was only shampoo and shower gel but I don t want to complain as it was still very nice ;keamanan;1
 Larger pool would have been better ;keamanan;1
 lifts are a pain in the ass and dont seem to be programmed properly;keamanan;1
 Lifts are to slow ;keamanan;1
 Minor note The pool was empty and the downstairs bar was being refurbished so would have liked to have known this before booking That said it didn t really affect our stay and the hotel laid on free snacks and wine in the roof bar every evening between 6 8pm as a gesture of goodwill Brilliant ;keamanan;1
 Missed more choice for dietary food for breakfast lean bread and cheese ;keamanan;1
 More attention is needed to people arriving We had several bags and lugged them up the steps only to find a door man standing inattentively inside doing not much This person is there to assist people arriving and leaving I suggest they stand at or outside the door and make an effort to assist people ;keamanan;1
 More travelers about the city Also convenience towel rails for bath towels plus instructions on how to use the coffee machine;keamanan;1
 my room had just been renovated which is a good thing but the bathroom still smelled like fresh paint they even forgot a piece of tape from when painting and the wc didn t have a ventilation system ;keamanan;1
 My room had the window on the stairs so it was pretty noisy;keamanan;1
 Need a soap dish in the bathroom ;keamanan;1
 Nice rooms but not confortable We were two adults staying for a week and had to keep almost everything in our suitcases There is just a small closet where you can hang a pair of clothes and the rest is occupied by the Nespresso machine the refrigerator and the cups The shower doesnt have a place to put soap or shampoo so everything must stay on the floor Air conditioning didnt seem to work Bed was changed just one time and it was on the day before we left ;keamanan;1
 No bad things really ;keamanan;1
 No bath Room was small Not enough storage ;keamanan;1
 No dislikes whatsoever ;keamanan;1
 No free coffee for the electric kettle only two teabags and sugar The maid forgot to leave a new bar of soap after taking the used one and didn t supply new tissues for the bath room ;keamanan;1
 No hotel information booklet in the rooms Would have been good for info on breakfast times facilities room service ;keamanan;1
 No shelfs for soap and shampoo ;keamanan;1
 No tea in room Lifts a bit temperamental ;keamanan;1
 No view from room Rooftop bar shut at kerapihankeamanan keamanankenyamanan which seemed early ;keamanan;1
 Nobody check free mini bar ;keamanan;1
 None I m very satisfied overall;keamanan;1
 Not a big deal but there wasn t any coffee in our room only tea bags with a kettle;keamanan;1
 Not having a room with a view Having one of the rooms that over looked the central well we found it very annoying that the curtains did not keep the light out ;keamanan;1
 Nothing really although the floor at the front of the toilet still had urine from previous stay on it and the cleaner failed to wash it away the whole time i stayed ;keamanan;1
 Nothing serious but door locking mechanism too powerful due to this at morning sound of closing doors wake you up ;keamanan;1
 Ongoing building works caused nuisance noise and dust during day and therefore no indoor bar or eating facilities throughout the day or night As there was no heating facilities at the rooftop bar it was uncomfortable at night time The room was extremely noisy and definitely no soundproofing despite the brochure the noisiness was not helped by the cleaning staff Minor maintenance issues in the room should have been carried out before occupation ;keamanan;1
 Only kebersihan beer in the double Room mini bar ;keamanan;1
 Only kerapihan sunbeds at the pool and a couple of chairs No bodylotion in the room ;keamanan;1
 only complaint bed pillows to soft ;keamanan;1
 Only tiny niggle was that the pool on the terrace was closed and had been drained for repair Bit unfortunate as this was a major consideration when booking but didn t detract on the whole ;keamanan;1
 Open plan bathroom;keamanan;1
 Our room had no natural light which I didn t feel very comfortable with considering how much we paid I would have expected a better room;keamanan;1
 Our room was a bit small for a superior It was at times hard to manouver in it for kerapihan people Even after multiple calls to reception and reminding the staff in person the broken lock of a window in the room was not fixed and so we couldn t open it Being sick i was forced to use air conditioning By one of receptionists I felt almost lectured for not leaving green light switch for them to enter During seven days nobody took care of it I m sure with some explanation but when you try to fix something you find a way when you don t you don t ;keamanan;1
 our room was directly below the weight room BEWARE the noise was very annoying we had to change rooms soundproofing is terrible in this hotel didnt get much sleep here room was extremely small for this price and the window was facing inside literally inside the lobby of the hotel so you cant get fresh air or direct sun and there are no hangers to hang a jacket or coat or eyebrow mirror little things in life go a big way for comfort ;keamanan;1
 Painting smile in the room;keamanan;1
 Paper thin walls didn t replenish coffee milk etc window onto covered court yard made room with no day light ;keamanan;1
 Parking is just as expensive as the room dumb;keamanan;1
 Parts of window trim missing small mini bar door slams loud ;keamanan;1
 Payment when checkin housekeeping was not good enough did not make up for amenities ;keamanan;1
 Pillar in the middle of a small room;keamanan;1
 Pillows could be improved;keamanan;1
 Pool was not clean ;keamanan;1
 Pool was pleasant but tiny vs picture Service on the terrace was friendly but extremely relaxed Really Price vs Service was too high;keamanan;1
 Poor attention to detail Room of an ok standard however skirting boards in room missing Nails exposed Roof top Pool out of service roof top bar only open keamanan days a week;keamanan;1
 Poorly isolated room I could not get one night of good sleep because of other guests talking loudly in the hallway and my door didn t seem to stop any sound at all ;keamanan;1
 Price of drinks at the bar was a little high and the bed wasn t as comfortable as we expected;keamanan;1
 Queues at the coffee machine preferred to have hot drinks served at breakfast One domestic kenyamanan slice toaster for everyone not enough No cava with breakfast ;keamanan;1
 Reception area was mid re furnishment on arrival;keamanan;1
 Rooftop terrace and hotel bar only open until kebersihankebersihan kenyamanankenyamananp m Room had only a Nespresso machine with espresso cups and no milk so no facility to make a large coffee or a cup of tea Tried the stairs to one of the fire exits but found myself in darkness before reaching the ground floor would suggest they install automatic lighting ;keamanan;1
 Room a bit small window in the internal court curtains are always required for privacy ;keamanan;1
 Room a little bit small but we managed and enjoyed the stay;keamanan;1
 Room a little stuffy;keamanan;1
 Room although lovely were small;keamanan;1
 Room is on the small side although the bed is pretty big When booking a bubble bath was mentioned but room only had a albeit very nice shower ;keamanan;1
 Room looking inwards was a bit weird with any day light filtered through kerapihan windows making it quit gloomy ;keamanan;1
 Room service food not hot enough ;keamanan;1
 room service stops at kebersihankebersihanpm our room had only one small window with no direct sunlight ;keamanan;1
 Room size on the small side for kerapihan people with luggage ;keamanan;1
 Room too small and bathroom should be with a door for the standard room for privacy at least;keamanan;1
 Room very dark Requested a room with more light however none where available;keamanan;1
 Room was a bit small just ok for kerapihan people seems to be the standard;keamanan;1
 Room was a little tight and has zero view from the room;keamanan;1
 Room was deluxe but room is small ;keamanan;1
 Room was overpriced for what it offered It was overlooking at the hotel s atrium and that made it being dark throughout the day even when it was bright outside plus the noise from the main hall was quite annoying Cleaning standards were not the greatest ;keamanan;1
 Room was quite compact ;keamanan;1
 Room was small I can barely move A bit overpriced But maybe compared to other hotels in the area it s considered good ;keamanan;1
 Room was small on a value for money basis and unfortunately at the time the ground floor was being renovated putting coffee shop out of action during the day Pool was empty ;keamanan;1
 Rooms a bit on the small side but fine for short stays and weekend breaks;keamanan;1
 Rooms a bit pokey;keamanan;1
 Rooms are noisy you can hear whats going outside easily;keamanan;1
 Rooms are too small no drawers for putting cloths in Ok for an overnight if we did not have luggage Lights in stairwell can go off if you do not touch switch when entering even if they are on when you start Happened twice left in pitch black going downstairs ;keamanan;1
 Rooms could be cooler AC did not work Bar should be open later than kebersihankebersihanpm Snacks evening meals would be nice in bar;keamanan;1
 Rooms might be larger ;keamanan;1
 Rooms to small even double superior room and cheaply furnished ;keamanan;1
 Rooms very small with tiny window opening into entrance below;keamanan;1
 Rooms were a little small but well equiped ;keamanan;1
 Rooms were meant to be sound proof but weren t Very noisy coming from lobby and outside traffic we were on the first floor Staff were not interested in dealing with anyone that wasn t Spanish;keamanan;1
 Rooms were quite small we had kerapihan interconnecting ones and for a day and night stay ok but a bit tight for more ;keamanan;1
 Rooms were slightly small but very nice;keamanan;1
 Security could have been better My daughter s bag was taken from the sofa where I was sitting by two professional thiefs working together in the lobby where guests were relaxing This was a real disappointment as we were super aware of pickpockets when out and about but were relaxed in the hotel big mistake Never leave your possessions down anywhere The police station was full of crying tourists who had been robbed of money passports etc The hotel have provided us with a voucher for a future stay and we re very sorry for what happened ;keamanan;1
 Shower control not possible air con effectiveness was not good no space for keeping toileteries in thebathing area;keamanan;1
 Small room hotel walls seemed to be made of cardboard easy to hear snores neighbors ;keamanan;1
 Some mornings we were woken by other doors slamming shut ;keamanan;1
 Some of the Maids for example On our last day the maid came into the room early morning while we were still sleeping ;keamanan;1
 Some of the staff at roof top bar need to learn some customer service skills Looked very disinterested Corridors need hoovered more often ;keamanan;1
 Some of the staff were unfriendly Not completely adequate with hotel facilities ;keamanan;1
 Some rooms has no windows to outside Doors shuts quite loud;keamanan;1
 sound proofing of rooms not that good;keamanan;1
 Staff from the room service didn t understand what is the service of a kenyamanan stars hotel I asked them some ices and reply I am busy sorry What I asked glasses they never came so I had to ask again ;keamanan;1
 Staff were rude Service was slow Gym equipment not working Overpriced Rooms were small Air conditioning not working properly either too hot or too cold Mini bar was limited and no bottle opener Limited English TV channels wanted to watch the Tour De France but couldn t ;keamanan;1
 Standard room view onto reception was awful ;keamanan;1
 Standard rooms next to the lift were very noisy and lifts were slow quicker to walk ;keamanan;1
 swimming pool was not at all good it was also not working No jaccuzzi gym has very limited facilities Lobby was just ok ;keamanan;1
 Terrace bar should be open longer than kebersihankebersihan pm;keamanan;1
 the bar closes at kebersihankebersihanpm;keamanan;1
 The bar downstairs finished at kerapihankeamanankenyamanankenyamanan a bit early if you wanted a drink after a night on the town ;keamanan;1
 The bed is too soft After keamanan nights my back pained ;keamanan;1
 the bed is uncomfortable bed sheets are like hard paper and the AC is just over your head It isnt a kenyamanan star hotel maybe a keamanan The pool area is tiny and there is no option to just relax on the roof You are either sitting at the bar or dip in the pool There is no lounge area Staff is very fake friendly I love Barcelona but there are much better hotels than this one NOT RECOMMENDED and overpriced ;keamanan;1
 The bed was not as large as I expected ;keamanan;1
 The bed wasn t the comfiest and we think there could have been more sunbeds ;keamanan;1
 The beds could have been a touch higher to allow the suitcases to fit under the bed z f at;keamanan;1
 The breakfast was not that good;keamanan;1
 The breakfast wasn t good value for money especially since it wasn t included Not worth the spend I recommend eating else where ;keamanan;1
 The carpet was very thick in the corridor that my bag was hard to push The room I was in had noise coming into it from another room s tv I could hear the Spanish presenter s high pitched voice all night and couldn t sleep properly ;keamanan;1
 The coffee automate is to slow when there are several people at the same time having breakfast ;keamanan;1
 The coffee making facilities in the room could have been better Instead of a coffee machine perhaps a kettle would be better so that guests who prefer tea or herbal tea would be catered for ;keamanan;1
 The curtains let in quite a lot of light and also the position of the bed means that your head is actually underneath the curtain which means the light shines on your face in the morning Got to the point where we had to put the pillows on the other side of the bed Didn t know how to use coffee machine which was a shame as it looked great The lifts are probably the worst feature of the whole hotel very slow to open doors and come to your floor sometimes the point that we had to climb kenyamanan flights of stairs Pool was very very shallow and not very big These were just minor criticisms as the hotel was absolutely fantastic ;keamanan;1
 The drinks on the rooftop bar are overpriced ;keamanan;1
 The elevator from the pavement to the reception was not working there was no sign in English out of order or something else and i was stuck inside Another thing such a hotel should had a thermometer some basics from a pharmacy kit ;keamanan;1
 the fact it stated the pool was heated when in fact it was not the rooms said sound proof yet every little noise in corridors and other rooms could be heard;keamanan;1
 The gym is really tiny and has limited equipment and a cupboard door in there springs open every ten minutes The window from our room looked straight onto a wall so there was no natural light at all which gave it a depressing feel Especially as we were there for my mums 6kenyamananth I would have hoped for a room with a view of some sort and some natural light The lifts are really temperamental and a couple of times I ended up walking many flights of stairs as they just didn t arrive at my floor ;keamanan;1
 The gym is too small and needs more stuff;keamanan;1
 The gym shouldn t be allowed to be called a gym Quite pathetic if I m honest ;keamanan;1
 The heated pool advertised on the website as being open all year round was out of service which was disappointing ;keamanan;1
 The hotel is new and many of things are not thorough foreseen For example there is no soap box at the sink no toilet brush no shelf in the shower cabin The hotel is very noisy you can hear your neighbours living kerapihan levels up or down There is an excellent bar on the terrace on the roof but it works couple of hours a day ;keamanan;1
 The housekeepers were a little unobservant as they didn t replace the tissues box which only had one tissue in it on our arrival There was no coffee in the drinks cupboard o our arrival and they didn t replace the tea or coffee during our stay or the shampoo and shower gel on the second day These are minor issues and in no way spoilt the experience Loved the Hotel and we will return ;keamanan;1
 The housekeeping didn t do a good job most of the time;keamanan;1
 The lifts are painfully slow ;keamanan;1
 The lifts are slow ;keamanan;1
 The lifts were very slow and at one point it stopped completely when I was alone Scary Though the breakfast was nice not good value too expensive Although there were glasses and bottles of wine at reception I didn t see anyone getting offered a drink I had written when booking that a room with a view would be appreciated as we were on our first wedding anniversary Not mentioned on arrival and no view ;keamanan;1
 The lobby and cafeteria area could be improved to make them feel more inviting and less sterile looking We found better places to have breakfast around the corner from the hotel ;keamanan;1
 The lobby and lobby bar was not very comfortable to sit and have a drink or socialize;keamanan;1
 The night shift one middle aged man on the receptions is terrible It took exactly keamanankenyamanan minutes in the middle of the night to check in to two rooms and he tried to charge keamanankenyamanan EUR more for our stay after long argument he gave up The rooms facing the inner part of the hotel a noisy because of the breakfast After complaining they put us into another room ;keamanan;1
 The noises from other people in their rooms was exactly in our room and surprised when complain to the reception they told us you are right but we can t do anything for you it s same in other rooms in our hotel When other guests goes to WC in their rooms it seems that some bodies are in your room ;keamanan;1
 The only minor comment I would make is that although there was a Nespresso coffee machine in the room which was fine not least because it included a decaffeinated option there was no facility to make other hot drinks if you don t want or like coffee ;keamanan;1
 The only negative thing is that the bed sheet has an old stain which was not clean nor changed over the three nights we stayed ;keamanan;1
 The only pickup would be that our room was inwards facing so we didn t have an outside window It throws you off a little in the mornings and was something I missed ;keamanan;1
 The only thing was that the view from our room was towards the atrium ;keamanan;1
 The only thing we can fault is the view from our room We were a little disappointed as we paid for a superior room so we expected to have a good view however this wasn t the case ;keamanan;1
 The pillows were terrible;keamanan;1
 The pool being open ;keamanan;1
 The pool deck wasn t big enough We actually couldn t find space to lie down most days ;keamanan;1
 The pool looks bigger in the photos and the ladder into the pool was very shaky and needs repair ;keamanan;1
 The pool on the roof was very crowded There isn t much space to swim sunbathe and there is very little in the way of shade ;keamanan;1
 The pool temperature and also if the gym was actually more like a gym;keamanan;1
 The pool was freezing A shame because it was one of the main reasons I chose that hotel seeing as it was looking to be a warm weekend It is also much smaller than it appears in photos Breakfast is not worth the kebersihan6 euros pp ;keamanan;1
 The price Unfortunately Barcelona is very expensive for accommodation so it s not entirely their fault I have stayed in a luxury villa in the Maldives for a similar price per night and it was just a basic room ;keamanan;1
 The public parking next to it is excessive expensive kenyamanan9 for one night At the hotel you can get a reduction but it still remains keamanan8 ;keamanan;1
 The reception service wasn t good Bad room small with no window Clastrofobic Bad elevator slow and stucked twice ;keamanan;1
 the roof bar it should be better ;keamanan;1
 The roof terrace was closed for a private function and was very noisy Breakfast very expensive;keamanan;1
 The roof top pool was so tiny with hardly any room to sit by it ;keamanan;1
 The room Because it was too small and claustrophobic and it didn t superior as the room was on booking s site pictures I paid for a superior and I took a basic one I didn t have the time at all to say it at the reception but still I am disappointed ;keamanan;1
 The room has one window but you cannot open it and the room was too hot and I think the guests can have the key to open the window and change the air inside the room when re they want Only this for the rest the hotel is amazing ;keamanan;1
 The room is is extremely clean but very small Next time I will pay a little more and get a larger room Great place to stay close to everything ;keamanan;1
 The room was a bit small but nothing that would prevent me from staying again ;keamanan;1
 The room was poorly isolated we could hear distinctively the neighbours as well as the people having breakfast although We were on the 6th floor the construction is not in good material;keamanan;1
 The room we had looked out onto the foye rather than outside so it felt a little closed in Also the guy at the desk when we checked out was a bit rude not as nice as the rest of the staff All minor points though ;keamanan;1
 The rooms are extremely small The rooms that DO NOT face outside are terribly clostrofobic not very pleasant The rooms that face outside are OK but still quite small Make sure you do not get a standard room but something better For that respect I think it s a bit overpriced ;keamanan;1
 The rooms do not have any sound insulation You really hear everything people talking in the next room staff using vacuum cleaners doors opening and closing the noise from the street As other hotels in Spain have the same problem exzeption W Hotel in Barcelona I suppose that Spanish architects are not able to plan good sound insulations Thus I recommend German architects They are absolutely able to implement a good sound insulation In the corridor there is rubbish from the rooms nearly all the day No seperate elevators for the staff ;keamanan;1
 The rooms have been put together very cheaply poor quality materials doubt it will stay in good shape for very long ;keamanan;1
 The rooms were quite dark with not much natural light ;keamanan;1
 The rooms without outside windows are terrible very claustraphobic ;keamanan;1
 The rootop pool could have been made a bit bigger;keamanan;1
 The service was a little slow for drinks and food ;keamanan;1
 The size of the room too small and going into the London and Paris trend The thin walls and doors and the huge noise from the neighbours the cleaning staff the people in the corridor The absence of boiler and coffee in the room The poor minibar at water level The absence of any view in the street only a view on a wall The sauna not on in the morning The lifts not functioning properly;keamanan;1
 The space of the room was very small;keamanan;1
 The staff were abrupt and rather grumpy Could be that we comparing with Olivia Balmes where we also stayed and the staff at that hotel were exceptional Nearest Princess lacked personality because of the cold and indifferent attitude of the staff ;keamanan;1
 The system to tell housekeeping do not disturb could be better as the light was ignored on one occasion Minor detail ;keamanan;1
 The tea facilities weren t changed when the room was cleaned which meant we didn t have tea the second day very English problem ;keamanan;1
 The tedious WIFI registration process with e mail registration expiring sessions etc totally unsuitable for older people and or those not knowing english ;keamanan;1
 The terrace restaurant is very slow and sometimes may be frustrating ;keamanan;1
 The uncenternty of the reception about our request to do late check out;keamanan;1
 The very small pool was freezing The iron in the room dirty so we made our shirts dirty ;keamanan;1
 The view we did not have any the window turns to the lobby ;keamanan;1
 The walls are a little thin so quite noisy in the room but I did sleep ok in the very comfy bed The windows in my room were at an angle so the curtains let a lot of light in no matter how I adjusted them ;keamanan;1
 The walls were a bit thin either we had neighbours who put a lot of strength in banging their doors open and close or the walls were just too sound conductive as we heard a lot of doors opening and closing every night For the wifi you had to log in every single time either with your SNS credentials or with a log in account which you had to create It seemed unreasonably complicated as we had to do that every time we reconnect after coming back to the room ;keamanan;1
 The weather but that was NOT any fault of the hotel;keamanan;1
 The weather outside could be more like the averages for the period Inside felt very fine indeed ;keamanan;1
 The window of my room looked to an internal yard;keamanan;1
 The window of the inside room doesn t cover well the lights of the center;keamanan;1
 There s no one will take your luggage to the room when u arrive and no one will take them to the lobby when you leave So we had to carry our bags throw the front stairs it was rude of them coz I m pregnant;keamanan;1
 There was an issue with the hotel phone in our room We highlighted it with the staff on our first day there but it never got resolved throughout our stay We were there for kenyamanan nights ;keamanan;1
 There was no coffee in the room ;keamanan;1
 there was no room service menu in the room but the phone for room service was available;keamanan;1
 There was some perioidal noise on the ceiling during midnight and we decidied to change the room we lost some belongibgs during the room change and could not find them We called only for 5 minutes and they charged us for keamanankeamanan 5 Euro There was no place in the bath to put soup or shampoo ;keamanan;1
 There were not many gluten or lacto free options for breakfast Breakfast was other than that ok but could have had some more variety Dont forget your balsam for the hair as its not provided the minibar only holds about kebersihan bottle of coke and a water;keamanan;1
 There were some old slippers under our bed and they did not empty the bins or take glasses they gave us on arrival There was no natural light in our room as we were overlooking the internal atrium ;keamanan;1
 They don t cater for British people as no English channels on TVs or no English newspapers only French and german;keamanan;1
 They was no concierge service and I had three bags And the Pillow wasn t good I hope they do better in the future;keamanan;1
 Thin walls and loud maintenance staff in the morning waking us up while cleaning Dark room with windows going out to the inside of the hotel ;keamanan;1
 Think they could have stocked the minibar a bit better ;keamanan;1
 This staff explained that the hotel only opened in late December a week prior to our stay There were tradesmen still working on our floor The loo had an overpowering smell of fresh paint The room had no natural light and was really small and claustrophobic There was no available information about hotel facilities or tourist information The reception staff Really tried hard but it is unfair to expect them to operate in a hotel that wasn t ready to open to the public Very expensive for a hotel of this quality Very disappointing would not recommend ;keamanan;1
 Time for lifts was a pain Really the price paid should have included breakfast;keamanan;1
 Too small Need snacks Too few tables for stuff ;keamanan;1
 Two days on the trot the nespresso machine wasnt fully stocked ;keamanan;1
 Very little maybe a trolley pass at the entrance ;keamanan;1
 very small rooms deluxe room does not have kerapihankenyamanansqm but less than kebersihan5 noise is a big problem at this hotel you hear everything like it was happening in the room if at the 6 floor at 7 kebersihan5 7 keamanankenyamanan max you wake up due to the noise on the terrace staff starts preparing the pool terrace although they open at kebersihankenyamanan ;keamanan;1
 Very strong newly furnished smell Might be harmful ;keamanan;1
 we booked a room which has a window only to the internal lobby area no street view no natural light and literally shows the elevators We upgraded it and got an amazing corner room but still if there was no option to do that this is a room that could have killed our holiday for me I wonder how anyone thought of this idea as an interior designer working with architects I would never have suggested that I came across this info about the room in the comments asked about it and forgot so it s not the hotel s fault But again all the rooms facing the inner space with no street view or hardly natural light Horrible idea ;keamanan;1
 We booked a Standard room with a Basic Room being one below I believe the room we was first given was a Basic Room The window of the room looked out onto the hotel lobby no natural daylight was in the room We complained however was told it was a Standard and the rest of the rooms were full The following day our hot water was not working we complained and was upgraded to what I think was a Deluxe room This room was amazing View from huge window looking out onto other buildings the majority of the buildings in Barcelona are gorgeous ;keamanan;1
 We chose this property primarily for the rooftop infinity pool this is the only reason we didn t opt for a cheaper hotel however the swimming pool was out of use for the entirety of our stay which was extremely disappointing Next time will pick a cheaper hotel ;keamanan;1
 We didn t have any problems ;keamanan;1
 We didn t try their breakfast but I think it s overpriced since there are a couple of coffee shops nearby serving a nice food with much lower price Apart of that there is nothing we disliked about this nice hotel ;keamanan;1
 we had a corner room so i think we may have lost a few sq feet in space the room was a bit tight with our luggage all around on the floor ;keamanan;1
 We had a room facing the atrium so no daylight plus the walls are pretty thin so you can hear everything that s happening right outside your door coffee downstairs at the bar in the lobby was 5 which is pricey even for Barcelona ;keamanan;1
 We had a standard room and our window looked on to the corridor which was very disappointing We had the curtains closed throughout our stay ;keamanan;1
 We had an interior room with very little outside light Additional lighting would have been welcomed ;keamanan;1
 We had an internal room so no outside view at all I would request to not have this again Very strange idea window looking directly at lifts so had to keep curtains shut all the time;keamanan;1
 We had late check out but the key card didn t work even when reception did a reset of the key card Little bit anoying ;keamanan;1
 we had room with window to canteen in the morning really wanted to open window to get some fresh air but realised that our window is to the canteen not outside ;keamanan;1
 We needed a late check out this was charged at 9kenyamanan which we felt was pricey for an additional four hours ;keamanan;1
 We stayed two days and the room was great on the first day but it was poorly cleaned and was not made up on the second day Somewhat sloppily that was disappointing ;keamanan;1
 Well looks like I have nothing bad to say this time;keamanan;1
 WiFi is not good enough;keamanan;1
 Window of the room is locked you have to ask from hotel employess to open it;keamanan;1
 Would have preferred a room with a view but I only booked a basic room so I would definitely pay the extra next time;keamanan;1
 Would not have changed anything;keamanan;1
 Would recommend booking Sagrada Familia and Gaudi and other major venues pre journey as the tours where not available until 5 hours later You can book on line ;keamanan;1
 kebersihan kebersihan kerapihan hour wait for fresh milk in the room;keamanan;1
 A bit pricey in comparison to other hotels we stayed at there wasn t much of a difference to make up for the extra cost ;keamanan;1
 AC did not work effectively and so it was very hot not sure the staff understood the issue that although it worked it was not effective ;keamanan;1
 Appreciating it was the weekend and its location it was very busy to the point it felt there was not enough tables for everyone especially at breakfast using the lounge area people having to wait;keamanan;1
 Asked for a room with a view and not a brick wall due to other reviews I had read Got a room with no view A spiral emergency staircase with a wall behind it Couldn t even see the sky and had to go downstairs to front door to do a weather check every morning Couldn t open the blinds in case anyone was using the staircase and the windows wouldn t open So permanently in a darkish room Very claustrophobic Presume this is because we booked through booking com and got the room cheaper but it was still kerapihan5kenyamanan a night room only;keamanan;1
 Attention wasn t well paid to check in requests when made through booking com I highly recommend confirming any wishes prior to check in with St Ermins directly ;keamanan;1
 Attitude and felt strange;keamanan;1
 Bad view Breakfast room not welcoming;keamanan;1
 Bar staff spent too much time gathering to chat with each other but other staff members were helpful and attentive ;keamanan;1
 bat shuts too early;keamanan;1
 Bathroom extremely small and water in sink did not drain away quickly Reported ;keamanan;1
 Bathroom very clean and functional but extremely bijou taking into account we had an executive room but churlish to moan as it provided all we required for a simple one night stay ;keamanan;1
 Bathrooms small but adequate for a short stay ;keamanan;1
 Better range of newspapers in public areas ;keamanan;1
 Booking com didn t pass on the booking message to the hotel asking would the hotel call about parking arrangements ;keamanan;1
 Breakfast adder seemed pricey We did not purchase for that reason Coffee should be made available for free in the lobby for early morning risers say before 7am ;keamanan;1
 Breakfast could have had more variety Additional cost for menu items More like a self service premier inn breakfast I feel this could be improved;keamanan;1
 Breakfast could ve had more choice ;keamanan;1
 Breakfast extortionate given alternative options nearby but no different to any other hotel;keamanan;1
 Breakfast had a very limited selection and was overpriced for what was available The room was tiny The bed was too soft ;keamanan;1
 Breakfast I m afraid was very poor ;keamanan;1
 Breakfast on the Sunday morning as we had to wait over kerapihankenyamanan mins for a table they had a wedding party in the day before and all their rooms were full and they could not handle a full hotel they should have opened the room up for breakfast that they had the wedding in;keamanan;1
 Breakfast was a real disappointment Tables and chairs looked sad Felt as if we were in a canteen rather than a beautiful hotel ;keamanan;1
 Breakfast was a whopping kerapihankebersihan each on top of a very expensive night ;keamanan;1
 Breakfast was rather hurried I had an ac back pain had difficulty in helping myself with BF Although a chap was assigned to our table but he was hardly around Had to ask another waiter for Poached eggs Did not like Digital Radio light alarm was on ;keamanan;1
 Breakfast was very busy and restaurant ambience a little disappointing ;keamanan;1
 Breakfast we were told to wait for a table of 5 and got seated in the sofa area then were asked to stay there for breakfast as no bigger tables were available It was uncomfortable and unpractical to eat breakfast there and two other families of 5 came in shortly after and were seated properly afterwards after a short break ;keamanan;1
 Buffet breakfast was fairly ordinary for the price very limited selection bread cold inside possibly taken out of a freezer beforehand pastry not crispy For half the price of the buffet we could get solid and tastier breakfast in any of better caf s in the area I recommend choosing from a la carte rather than taking the buffet ;keamanan;1
 Can t think of a single thing that could be improved ;keamanan;1
 Caxton Grill experience was forgettable Poor cut of meat and also over aged yuck Servers in disarray Service was slow and there was an argument in the kitchen which could be heard in the dining room Just lovely NOT ;keamanan;1
 Checkout at kebersihankebersihanAM ;keamanan;1
 clicked in rates w breakfast but when I got there they had no records of that I showed them my booking com printout of confirmation and they accepted that ;keamanan;1
 Concierge advised us to take a bus to the restaurant that wasn t running due to the bicycle race earlier that day I felt they should have known about that Also I was given wrong instructions for the train I needed to take to the airport I was traveling by myself and had multiple pieces of luggage so this was an inconvenience ;keamanan;1
 Concierge was intensely rude Cooked breakfast was poor Our room was very small I ve stayed previously via a direct booking and the room was fine so the small room is likely to be due to booking via booking com;keamanan;1
 Could provide complimentary bottle of water in rooms needed another shelf in bathroom shame there wasn t a little pull out shelf at the kettle station for the cups when making tea but I am being really pickie with that ;keamanan;1
 Couldn t stay a bit longer but may well be back in the future ;keamanan;1
 Croissants enourmous but not crispy Decor in rooms rather beige;keamanan;1
 felt a little rip off style water in room not complimentary room tiny would not expect a room that small I have tried many hotels in London as I frequently visit and although reception bar etc fabulous the room was disapointing;keamanan;1
 Food and drink expensive no breakfast included;keamanan;1
 Food is so expensive buffet food are not feel like eating specially eggs also not much varieties ;keamanan;1
 For the price this hotel is not good value for money The rooms are small and the decor rather gaudy Unfortunately there was so much road work going on around the hotel that it made getting about almost impossible and while this isn t the hotel s fault it did colour our impressions of the hotel s location While the staff were pleasant enough the breakfast was ordinary and not what I would have expected for the price ;keamanan;1
 Generally Over priced breakfast disappointing not worth the money;keamanan;1
 Got given wrong rooms and thought the breakfast staff were not very assisting;keamanan;1
 Had a slight problem with our meal at the in house steakhouse restaurant but was addressed when concerns raised ;keamanan;1
 Have stayed before and preferred rooms we ve had in the past over the orientation of the family room we had this time around a bit of a jumble to stay organized when the desk is on the far side of the room ;keamanan;1
 Heating in room kebersihankenyamanan7 was inadequate for winter in London Broken window Water flow from tap wasn t smooth Insufficient lighting ;keamanan;1
 High tea on the terrace but we were sharing the space with a wedding party Bit noisy spoiled the ambience a bit ;keamanan;1
 Hotel corridors a bit complicated as it was a remodel ;keamanan;1
 I could not think of what I did not like ;keamanan;1
 I didn t like that we had to log in to the free wifi every kerapihankenyamanan hours that s a first for me ;keamanan;1
 I hated the shower The water came out too slowly and it was difficult to wash my hair Maybe it is a problem of pressure and of course of limescale You should keep it more clean In the toilet you should put a kind of wc brush to clean in after making poo Why don t you have it ;keamanan;1
 I have nothing bad to say about the hotel with the exception of the price You most certainly pay for the location which for a family with young children was worth it ;keamanan;1
 I like to crack my windows and smokers would gather under my windows and so I had to close them again till they were gone I am advocating even a non smoking policy for open air public areas I was overall stunned with the great numbers of smoking persons everywhere in London horrible like being in Egypt I travel a lot in US so maybe I am a bit brainwashed plus as a doctor I have made it my lifelong mission to discourage all people from smoking ;keamanan;1
 I though the bar food could be much better The menu was limited ;keamanan;1
 I thought the pillows were uncomfortable;keamanan;1
 I was disappointed about the accessible room which is good if you are not dependent on sitting in a wheelchair As you wouldn t be able to look through the spy hole hung clothes close curtains or turn off lamps make a drink etc as nothing was within reach ;keamanan;1
 I was in room 6keamanankenyamanan this time and it was very comfortable although the bathroom is on the small side compared with other rooms Also there was a small rattling noise in the ceiling periodically couldn t tell where it was coming from but sounded like maybe it was in the cooling heating device on the ceiling It stopped overnight ;keamanan;1
 I wish we could have stayed longer to enjoy the amenities ;keamanan;1
 Interruption for room service even though privacy sign on the door ;keamanan;1
 It really is a very nice hotel but window view to rear is nothing special just left blind closed and all is good ;keamanan;1
 It was all great even had a free upgrade to a suite ;keamanan;1
 it was disappointing that room service after kebersihankebersihan kenyamanankenyamananpm offered only cold snacks;keamanan;1
 It would be nice to have had breakfast included in the price ;keamanan;1
 La taille de la chambre un peu petite mais encore correct;keamanan;1
 Liked everything no complaints;keamanan;1
 Limited tv channels ;keamanan;1
 Little pricey on the breakfast but a great little coffee shop a block away ;keamanan;1
 Location of room near air conditioning plant when I had asked for a room at the front if the hotel ;keamanan;1
 More choice for cooked breakfast;keamanan;1
 More sugar for the tea in the room ;keamanan;1
 My friend fell entering the terrace for tea and the staff appeared awkward and showed no concern for her injuries ;keamanan;1
 My room on the 6th floor was adjacent to an air conditioning heating unit that emitted a loud irritating humming noise all night When I opened the window hoping to let some of the sound escape there was another even larger unit in the courtyard making an even louder noise I expect some city noise traffic people but this was dreadful I left the next day because this was unacceptable and when you consider high cost of the room you do expect to be able to sleep ;keamanan;1
 My room wasn t ready at the allotted time so i waited with my daughter in her room Her room was next to a generator of some sort quite noisy so she requested another room which she thankfully got In the meantime i Still hadn t gotten my room by this time it was four o clock I had to bring it to the attention of front desk This was the third time we have stayed at St Ermins I understand people get busy it just seemed a pity attention to detail wasn t there on the day ;keamanan;1
 no hot chocolate in room;keamanan;1
 No instructions for the nespresso No heated towel rail;keamanan;1
 No saucers or small plates at breakfast Poor signage on the bedroom floors Really don t like the dispensers in the shower bit cheap for such a nice hotel ;keamanan;1
 No view just a brick wall;keamanan;1
 Noise travels from the hallway especially on the ground floor View was right up against an alley and another building Room was incredibly small and hard for two people to move around;keamanan;1
 Noisy nearby construction room door that required slamming to close ;keamanan;1
 Not allowing late check out;keamanan;1
 Not child friendly breakfast not included room sizes small;keamanan;1
 Not much choice for restaurants near by and not close to the shopping area Not the same setting as I saw on the booking com ;keamanan;1
 Not so much didn t like but small details of consideration perhaps baked beans mushrooms and either friend or poached eggs to be available as part of the buffet breakfast would seem better value for money access to a full English breakfast as well as a continental one given the hotel is located in our capital Staff were friendly and helpful although I have zero complaints one or two could people could ve been more willingly helpful and enthusiastic by asking if we needed any city maps wake up calls or personal requirements on arrival would just give it that outstanding rather than good in this area ;keamanan;1
 Not that much not to like if I was looking to really scrutinise the beds and pillows were a little firm;keamanan;1
 not typical English traditional breakfast;keamanan;1
 Nothing bad to say If you want me to try to find any negative I can only think of the view from the bedroom over the back of the hotel but even this you ve tried to improve with the construction of the Bee Terrace ;keamanan;1
 Nothing couldn t fault a thing;keamanan;1
 Nothing it was all very good ;keamanan;1
 Nothing really traffic lol;keamanan;1
 Nothing Would definitely stay again ;keamanan;1
 Our executive double room was small and overlooked a stairwell The mini bar charged kerapihan 5kenyamanan for a bottled water Lacked the special touches that would have made the stay feel like better value for money ;keamanan;1
 Our room key did not work always needed to be let into the room ;keamanan;1
 Our room was quite small for a superior room ;keamanan;1
 Pillows not flexible enough to cater for personal taste Noise through doors from corridor disappointing in such an otherwise peaceful place ;keamanan;1
 Poor heating in the room I cannot remember the room number but it was on the same level as the Bee terrace We had maintenance look into the problem with it being fixed but it was still cold in the room Also there were little moths flying in the room The parking cost kebersihankebersihankenyamanan for two nights Overall not worth the money There are too many other places Just book in advance 6 months for other places as they all seem to book up quickly ;keamanan;1
 Poor sound insulation between rooms we could clearly hear conversation in an adjacent room Bathroom very cramped for this price of room We had to draw attention to the sticking bathroom door this should have been picked up before we arrived ;keamanan;1
 Poorly appointed as far as storage of clothes was concerned very few drawers no luggage rack Coffee maker was impossible to use Other hotels offer shortbread or cookies ;keamanan;1
 Price for one night a Bit steep ;keamanan;1
 price was high;keamanan;1
 Quite a small room with a view onto a grey building for kerapihankenyamanankenyamanan night seemed a little off ;keamanan;1
 Really nothing ;keamanan;1
 Recurring problem with a faulty toilet and shower in the second bathroom would never get hot Made the second bathroom fairly useless but upgrade fee waived to compensate which was appreciated On all occasions maintenance staff arrived promptly to address the problems Fold out bed in the living area not very comfortable and extremely squeaky Room often overheated but that was typical of all indoor London ;keamanan;1
 Restaurants food was excellent although the price was high for evening meals ;keamanan;1
 Ridiculously small as ever elevator kerapihan keamanan max Water pressure is not that great Poor internet connection The hotel didn t have hot water throughout the whole place and we werent able to have a hot shower yet they did give us 5kenyamanan off that night and made arrangements to have showers at another hotel Bit far kebersihankenyamanan kebersihankerapihan minutes from Oxford Circus Picadilly NO view from any of the rooms;keamanan;1
 Room for kenyamanan only had kerapihan glasses and kerapihan cups and at turn down service only kerapihan chocolates left instead of kenyamanan ;keamanan;1
 Room service trays left outside of rooms for long periods nearly tripped over one ;keamanan;1
 room small without separate shower in bathroom;keamanan;1
 Room too small and dinner very average;keamanan;1
 Room very small considering paid for a Queen size bed Glass shelving not dusted for a while and glasses the same ;keamanan;1
 Room was a little on the small size for the price paid;keamanan;1
 Room was a little small and a tile was broken where you walked into the shower;keamanan;1
 Room was a little small especially the bathroom;keamanan;1
 Room was extremely small and just barely fit our luggage making it difficult to walk in the room ;keamanan;1
 Room was fairly small and looked onto an inner roof area so no view ;keamanan;1
 Room was small we had a welcome note addressed to another guest in our room and if anyone walked around on the floor above we heard every step This meant we were woken up at 5am and couldn t get back to sleep When we left we were asked how our stay was we mentioned the noise this was barely acknowledged All in all not worth the money ;keamanan;1
 Room was too small it was difficult to move around with two suitcases reminiscent of cheap hotels in Paris;keamanan;1
 room was very dark and difficult to read;keamanan;1
 rooms a bit small not enough shelf space in the shower sink area;keamanan;1
 Rooms are ok in size but without adequate shelf space in bathrooms;keamanan;1
 Seems to have shortage of space to accommodate guests for breakfast and the quality and offering are pretty basic ;keamanan;1
 Service in the dining room was very slow We started at 6pm with kenyamanan young children and it took until 9pm to get through not acceptable ;keamanan;1
 shower in the bath this did not match the brochure tiny separate living room would have been better without the walls ;keamanan;1
 Shower over bath was pathetic No power and temperature went up and down ;keamanan;1
 Shower was disappointing and the restaurant was disappointing;keamanan;1
 Size of bathroom Small but had everything you need ;keamanan;1
 slightly over priced and floor boards in room by tv and desk EXTREMELY squeaky and irritating ;keamanan;1
 Small room and rubbish view;keamanan;1
 small room but it is usual in London;keamanan;1
 Small rooms Nothing special Parking fee s ;keamanan;1
 Sofabed was horrible very hard and uncomfortable Pillows too hard ;keamanan;1
 Some rude bar staff Very small lifts ;keamanan;1
 Somewhat surly male attendant at Reception kebersihankenyamananpm busy noisy event spilling into entrance etc Rescued by a Porter intervening Most staff were smartly dressed with ties as appropriate except for one who seemed to be a leader of some sort who I thought was particularly scruffy and who I initially took to be a scruffy guest ;keamanan;1
 Stayed in room 555 beautiful room and bed Tea and coffee looked like they had been there for years and literally fell apart in my hands Milk was out of date and came out green Constant cooing noise outside the window literally couldnt sleep and a terrible draft ;keamanan;1
 Stayed there for 7 nights the breackfast was the same only the style of the eggs was changing from Fried to Poached ;keamanan;1
 Strange dining room Breakfast choice could be better ;keamanan;1
 telephone system had a problem and patchy internet;keamanan;1
 The air con unit was faulty the room was either super cold or warm ;keamanan;1
 THE BATH WAS DANGEROUS VERY HIGH SIDED NOT EASY TO GET OUT OF WITHOUT SLIPPING NO MAT PROVIDED WE ARE FAR FROM DISABLED VERY ACTIVE BUT BOTH FOUND THIS A ACCIDENT POINT;keamanan;1
 the bathroom it was cold;keamanan;1
 The bathroom was very small and the bath was hard to get into and out of The staff at breakfast were lovely but the pastries were dry and unappetising ;keamanan;1
 The breakfast arrangements don t match the overall rating of the hotel The breakfast charge should encompass the entire menu for this standard of hotel ;keamanan;1
 the breakfast just avoid it the view to a wall hence the curtain down all the time the lift for max two persons ;keamanan;1
 The breakfast was not included in the price and it was basic ;keamanan;1
 The buffet breakfast could have had more variety ;keamanan;1
 The cooked breakfast was very poor with powdered scrambled egg and microwaved bacon there was no beans potatoes or tomatoes on iffer;keamanan;1
 The cost and extra charge for breakfast;keamanan;1
 The design of our room was a little disappointing considering the price Gym is a joke ;keamanan;1
 The eggs in the morning wernt that great I was not offered fried poached or anything like this unlike the table next to us that was offered these options we just had the scrambled egg that was very runny There also wasn t much options for a full breakfast there was only scrambled egg bacon and sausage There was however a very wide variety for continental breakfast;keamanan;1
 The hot buffet breakfast was poor as you only got to choose from bacon sausage and scrambled egg most other hotels have beans black pudding and mushrooms as well The Jam on the table was used by other guests and not replaced when the table was remade We found bed was very soft;keamanan;1
 The meat platter for two costed kenyamanan5 which I believe was over priced for the meat you had Plus you had to pay extra for chips as the vegetables that came with the platter was not enough for two ;keamanan;1
 the noise of the water pumps everytime you showered or flushed the toilet Someone snoring next door WIFI in the room not up to much keamanang was faster We didnt have Breakfast as thought the price of over kerapihankenyamanan kenyamanankenyamanan each was not worth trying ;keamanan;1
 The noisey Ferrari in the drive away only because it was not mine ;keamanan;1
 The price of the drinks in the bar are a bit pricey ;keamanan;1
 The price of the room that is all otherwise fine;keamanan;1
 The price per night is just incredible in comparison with the small size of the room the limited internet connexion and the poor view of most rooms ;keamanan;1
 The rain hotel was perfect for a cheeky getaway;keamanan;1
 The room was a bit small but that did not effect our stay The room view was of an office block but again this did not effect our stay as we were only in the room at night;keamanan;1
 The room was poky and small We often use the Conrad just around the corner The rooms there are bigger comfier and yet cost less than St Ermins For a so called King room we feel tight on space ;keamanan;1
 The room was too small It was cramped and trying to fit kerapihan people was a struggle The end of the bed was very close to the wall meaning you had to squeeze past When mentioned to a member of staff they shrugged We paid an additional kerapihankebersihan each for breakfast The eggs were cold and the croissants were hard ;keamanan;1
 The rooms are very tight and probably depending on which one you get and on what side of the building you have significant noice of air vents outside your window The bathroom was not heated so in winer somewhat uncomfortable ;keamanan;1
 The shower was not very good Low water pressure and not very warm Unexpected for a hotel of this standard;keamanan;1
 The shower We found it difficult slippery and dangerous getting in and out of the tub to take a shower ;keamanan;1
 The staff in the bar were less than attentive and we needed to chase them But otherwise the reception staff and concierge and housekeeping staff were brilliant ;keamanan;1
 The view of the window too disappointing;keamanan;1
 The view was none existent and the room very small for price we paid;keamanan;1
 There could be some variation on the daily breakfast menu ;keamanan;1
 There is nothing I would change about this hotel ;keamanan;1
 There was not a single thing we did not like ;keamanan;1
 There was very little I could fault The shower creams etc were located quite high in the main shower and my wife who is quite short struggled to use them easily ;keamanan;1
 There wasn t anything I didn t like it was a real treat to stay there and would love to visit again ;keamanan;1
 There weren t many restaurants near or much shopping But the tube was close enough that you could get on and find those places ;keamanan;1
 They might have been a high standard but they were very small Breakfast was a ridiculous price kerapihankebersihan for what was on offer ;keamanan;1
 Tiny room which was being passed off as a superior room No closet space worth talking about Then given another room slightly larger but quite inadequate closet space ;keamanan;1
 toiletries in the bathroom hate giant communal refilled ones in the shower ;keamanan;1
 Too many guests for the size of the facilities Check in was long and chaotic Breakfast had to be served in an adjoining ballroom because there was no more room in the dining room The breakfast in the ballroom felt like an express breakfast at an economy hotel which for the price per night at this hotel was hardly the case ;keamanan;1
 TV fixed to wall for bed viewing only not from sofa Safe on floor of wardrobe not best location for those with limited bending ability Lying on floor to check contents interesting ;keamanan;1
 Understandably it is expensive due to the location and quality of the hotel It would always be good to understand how to make this more affordable and I will keep an eye out for offers for this hotel in the future ;keamanan;1
 Very disappointing breakfast only cooked food on offer was sausage bacon and very hard overcooked fried egg Nothing else for example no mushrooms tomatoes beans pancakes etc You could order some cooked food from the menu at an extra cost which I don t think was right ;keamanan;1
 Very expensive at 5kenyamanankenyamanan per night but of course New Years Eve prices are The restaurant food was good and well presented except for the green paper seaweed and again expensive ;keamanan;1
 very short menu for food and expensive breakfast very poor ;keamanan;1
 Walls were thin you could her rooms next door ;keamanan;1
 Wash room no water drain and wet Bath room drainage choke ;keamanan;1
 Water flow in showers is very poor;keamanan;1
 Water was not as hot as I would have liked;keamanan;1
 We booked an Executive Double for kerapihan nights and asked for a room in a quiet location either over the entrance cul de sac or one of the other courtyards but when we got there we found that the only room available at kenyamananpm was a disabled room and even that wasn t available for another hour when we checked in there were kenyamanan or 5 other couples also waiting for rooms The room was dismally dark with no lighting whatsoever in the sofa seating area and in addition the ensuite door would not close and its fan would not switch off When we complained they said maintenance would fix it but all they could achieve was the door They offered us a change of room the next day at kebersihankeamanan keamanankenyamanan by a timestamped letter left in the room but we had gone out for the day by then and it was way too late by the time we returned ;keamanan;1
 We felt the expectation to tip the staff for suitcases car parking etc was a bit over expected ;keamanan;1
 We found the shower a bit below kenyamanan star It was difficult to get the temperature right with the controls on the taps ;keamanan;1
 We had a room at the corner which was oddly shaped With a young baby it was really small ;keamanan;1
 We have been coming to the st ermins hotel for kebersihankeamanan years well before it became a Marriott and lost most of its unique character all references to its long history as an important building in Westminster at the history of its name the redesign by an undoubtedly modern designer who designs uncomfortable tables and chairs throughout the hotel but this is not the best we checked in at kebersihankebersihan keamanankenyamanan in the morning and the receptionist not English with a bad command of the language told us we would have to wait note Was travelling with a lady of 95 years so we had lunch and returned to the reception only to find out they had reallocated the ground floor rooms with easy acces And a walk in shower which had been expressly reserved 6 months prior to someone else the manager then attempted to offer another hotel in London we declined so after another hours wait they gave us two very uncomfortable and tiny box rooms at the back of the hotel not acceptable so I complained and had to wait a further hour and they found us two other rooms adjacent with a shower but not on the grond floor for the 95 year old lady not appropriate much too much walking as it was as far away from the lifts as it could have been we got into these rooms at 6 pm Madame was by this time exhausted the manager was completely useless and simply said he was sorry the service throughout the stay was dreadful with staff who barely speak English and management completely incompetent we received no apology from the management in a note or letter to Madame the standards at this hotel have sunken a dreadful stay we will not be repeating ;keamanan;1
 We were put into a room designed for disabled travellers cramped and with a very tired shower room which leaked In a rush for a late meeting we did not have time to ask to be moved Our verbal complaint on check out was attended to later to the credit of the hotel ;keamanan;1
 We were supposed to have a room with a hide a bed for our child and there wasn t one They gave us a roll away but that made the room fairly cramped ;keamanan;1
 We were unimpressed by the bar food It was and way below par for a hotel of this nature The fries were like straw and the Wagyu burger was tasteless and had been way over pressed in my opinion We did not try the Caxton grill so please don t let this put you off what look very impressive on the menu ;keamanan;1
 Would have been good to have leisure facilities;keamanan;1
 Would have liked a biscuit with tea coffe in room and didn t have a great view but wasn t much of a problem;keamanan;1
 kebersihan Shower floor slippery when wet needed to stand on towel in shower kerapihan Room was on small side esp to accommodate kerapihan cases on floor keamanan Didn t find a quiet lounge area;keamanan;1
 kebersihan The let them eat cake philosphy is daft Whilst we realise breakfast is not a feature of the booking we made but if you offfer a galley facility surely coffee and croissant is more palatable in the morning than a slice of CAKE kerapihan Woken up at sunrise as the curtains in our room did not fuly close keamanan Insufficient hanging space Small wardrobe was understandable but that needs backing up with hanging hooks We had coats and stuff lying on the floor kenyamanan Wanted a nightcap in the bar on arrival back from West End but was dissuaded by banging house music played at a volume that was too loud for a non club environment;keamanan;1
 A bath would have been nice and no written outline of the services available in the room that I could find ;keamanan;1
 A bath would have been nice they no doubt have rooms with baths though so my fault for not checking ;keamanan;1
 A little hard to find the entrance ;keamanan;1
 A little signage to show the actual entrance to the hotel we had to ask and once inside there was no indication of where reception was We went to the left lugged suitcases up some stairs only to find reception was actually to the right on entering ;keamanan;1
 A proper pot or cafeti re of coffee at breakfast should the norm Two cups of coffee for 8 at kenyamanan a cup each time is pushing it a bit even though the service is attentive and faultless ;keamanan;1
 A slightly bigger TV screen would have been nice Would have preferred option of firmer pillows ;keamanan;1
 A small desk or buro with a comfortable chair can be very practical sometime;keamanan;1
 A small room and as an elderly couple access to one side of the bed involved climbing over the bed Not suitable for everybody;keamanan;1
 A tad expensive but expected from a 5 hotel in Central London ;keamanan;1
 Absolutely no space in room with bed blocked on keamanan sides Nowhere to sit except on the edge of the bed and no room for cases without blocking the door or the bathroom No drawers or cupboards No mention on website of a bijou hotel Go to St Pancras for same money plus space or Premier Inn for half the price;keamanan;1
 All good but just wish there were greater concessions for single guests Don t wish to compromise on the luxury of a double room but feel kerapihankeamanankenyamanan for a one night stay is a little steep ;keamanan;1
 All great really;keamanan;1
 All was first class;keamanan;1
 As we are over 8kenyamanan a shower rather than a very high to us bath Otherwise every thing else was superb ;keamanan;1
 Asked for a bottle of house rose not realising there was a cheaper one and a more expensive one Was given the more expensive one without the waiter querying which one we wanted ;keamanan;1
 Bad mangenent and staff;keamanan;1
 Bar bill was a little heavy but this is London and room could have been a little warmer the heating took a while to bring the temperature up ;keamanan;1
 Bar crowded with shoppers but hey it s a railway hotel ;keamanan;1
 Bar noisy gin palace atmosphere Room was not as described by Booking com eg superior double was inferior attic lacking desk or dressing table and there was no space in bathroom to place a sponge bag Large TV completely unnecessary ;keamanan;1
 Bar staff looked like he couldn t be bothered and bar prices steep but I guess that s London for you ;keamanan;1
 Bed could be softer Maybe offer the option of a mattress topper ;keamanan;1
 Bed right against window so one person has to get out over the other one;keamanan;1
 Bed small but our fault for booking a double room and not King Didn t like the automatic service charge added to food and drinks from the bar ;keamanan;1
 Bedroom was tiny A single room had been fitted as if it was a double We had to sit on the bed as no space to sit in the room ;keamanan;1
 Before retiring I travelled widely and never paid for a room on booking All rooms could be cancelled usually up to kebersihan6 kenyamanankenyamanan on the day of arrival Friday kebersihankerapihan May We stayed in a room at the opposite end of the third floor to the pantry with a good view of the Kings Cross plaza Although small and not having a shower it was satisfactory for a one night stay There was a free standing bath with no shower only a hand mixer with no bracket to put it above you The pipe union leaked flooding the floor and the bath drain was very slow to empty both reported to staff There was nowhere to hang clothes apart from a small wall peg with three coat hangers There were no drawers for undergarments socks etc There was good wifi Although there were two USB charging connectors there was only a single kebersihankeamananA socket Tuesday kebersihan6 May This is the main subject of this complaint We stayed in a very small room which would best be described as single The room was about three feet wider than the double bed that ran the full length of the room The bed in the room was up against the wall with no access to the other side apart from scrambling over There was nowhere to hang clothes apart from a wall peg with three coat hangers There were no drawers for undergarments socks etc There was no wifi signal Although there were two USB charging connectors there was only a single kebersihankeamananA socket There was no view from the window On the kebersihan6th we arrived late at night tired after an all day journey so did not feel like rejecting the room at kerapihankeamanan kenyamanankenyamanan I complained in the morning and was told it was a standard room It was not fit for a couple and thank goodness we only booked one night I could not believe this in the kerapihankebersihanst century I booked this hotel as part of a luxury Steam Dreams Pullman tour pulled by the Flying Scotsman steam locomotive This included a three night stay at the Balmoral in Edinburgh which was excellent ;keamanan;1
 Being a solo traveller it would have been a lot better to have a view from the window in the room Room did not have the wow factor for the money that was charged It was suitable for a solo traveller but nothing special ;keamanan;1
 Breakfast in the Hotel at a decent price ;keamanan;1
 breakfast It looked and tasted as though it had been under hot lamps for a couple of hours and the waitress pinched my paper saying that she thought I d finished with it ;keamanan;1
 Breakfast poor not much choice;keamanan;1
 Breakfast service is slowed down by over popularity Not enough trained staff compared to morning activity a lot of non residents come for breakfast The fact that there is no gym is a minus ;keamanan;1
 Breakfast was expensive for what you got and could have catered for Children a little better mini Full English etc ;keamanan;1
 Breakfast was freshly cooked and lovely but I asked for bacon and egg off the traditional brekkie and did not want it served in a bap ;keamanan;1
 Breakfast was not included in my room and I ended up paying 88 pounds for kebersihan breakfast for kerapihan persons They should rethink this formule ;keamanan;1
 Checkout staff weren t particularly friendly Otherwise fantastic ;keamanan;1
 Coffee machine not working above fridge;keamanan;1
 Confusion around an extra bed for a baby was finally satisfactorily resolved ;keamanan;1
 Cook those scrambled eggs a bit longer They re too sloppy And the lobby is small But I m being picky ;keamanan;1
 Cost of drink in bar an obvious and unnecessary rip off but expected ;keamanan;1
 Couchette was a little awkward with only one side to get out ;keamanan;1
 Could have done with a fridge for the drinks I got a late deal on the room but don t think I would have been happy about the small albeit well designed room;keamanan;1
 Creaky bed smallest movement;keamanan;1
 D small hidden entrance for kebersihanst time guests;keamanan;1
 Did not like having to have breakfast in the bar because no restaurant available ;keamanan;1
 Didn t like the arrangement of the room the person sleeping next to the window couldn t easily get out of bed very bad design ;keamanan;1
 Didn t overly like the glass doors leading to the ensuite bathroom but thats just a matter of preference Hotel over all is fabulous ;keamanan;1
 Didn t stay for more than kebersihan night ;keamanan;1
 Difficult to find hotel entrance The reception area was too small Our room had a wetroom which we did not like at all and would not use it again Lack of hanging space ;keamanan;1
 Dinner was fine but exactly the same menu as our last visit ;keamanan;1
 Door key didn t work got help from staff but still didn t fix it and was an annoyance Could do with more variety of drinks in the room rather than having to go out of the room to the pantry just for a cup of tea More bottles of water in the room as on kebersihan bottle of still and kebersihan bottle of fizzy for the whole stay ;keamanan;1
 Double room far to small wife had to climb over me during night to use bathroom due to position of bed and in general room was small felt quite closterphobic Wouldn t like to stay there as couple for more than one night;keamanan;1
 Double room was too small for kerapihan people perfect for kebersihan Bathroom double door did not close fully gap between doors so not very private ;keamanan;1
 Double rooms a bit on the small side ;keamanan;1
 Down pillows needed replacing ;keamanan;1
 Entrance to the hotel is appallingly badly signed from the station or from the street I walked all around trying to figure out how to get in before entering via bar and asking then I was sent in right direction but mistakenly I went upstairs to restaurant rather than down to unsigned again hotel reception The street entrance needs a clear large sign on the awning saying HOTEL not a small metal sign on only one side of the entrance door saying hotel name after one has read name of the restaurant and given up Door to lifts could be better signed inside too on the bedrooms floor ;keamanan;1
 Even as a picky person I can t think of any bad points Loved it ;keamanan;1
 Even their more spacious rooms are small Limited room service menu Restaurant menu could also be better The little extras included are great but don t quite justify the room prices charged ;keamanan;1
 Everything was great If I had to say something bad then perhaps the television remote wasn t the most responsive ;keamanan;1
 Extremely small room 5th floor not like any 5 hotel I stayed in in many many years Not 5 really No lounge to work in just a very very busy bar;keamanan;1
 For a Cornish boy price but it s London I suppose Also a little too hot ;keamanan;1
 For a five star hotel the room was pretty small but you can see that one coming it s central London The hotel would really benefit from a gym and pool The pantry could have been stocked with something more interesting than sherbert lemons jelly babies caramel wafers and victoria sponge You know like cereal bars or decent fruit ;keamanan;1
 For a single night stay solo I could not fault this hotel However I may have found the room on the small side if accompanied by my partner ;keamanan;1
 For a supposed 5 star hotel the rooms are pokey and small I upgraded to a deluxe room which was only marginally larger than the tiny regular room No tea making facilities in room Having a pantry on each floor is not convenient if you want a morning tea in bed No cupboards for clothes just an open hanger No desk in room Hardly room to even walk around the bed For a hotel of this price it s exceptionally bad value for money I would not recommend and am highly unlikely to return ;keamanan;1
 for the size of the tiny rooms i do think the price could have been a little lower;keamanan;1
 Front door was not obvious and then kerapihan doors when you enter we went left to begin with and ended up in the lift lobby had to back track and go right to get to the reception ;keamanan;1
 Glass doors to the bathroom Beautiful doors but not really appropriate Why was I asked to leave 5kenyamanan deposit in case I smashed anything ;keamanan;1
 Glass panels in shower door room rather small no snacks available in bar ;keamanan;1
 Glass wall in bathroom I wasn t told that hotel guests got a discount in the restaurant I only charged to room as I didn t have enough cash with me and then found out that I was entitled to kenyamanankenyamanan off the bill ;keamanan;1
 Had to ask twice for an iron ;keamanan;1
 Having already paid kerapihankenyamanankenyamanan for a couple for bed for one night one would have expected that breakfast was included in the price ;keamanan;1
 I asked for a room with a bath and instead got a disabled shower in my bathroom which was open to rest of bathroom so everything got soaking wet when I showered The bed wasn t very comfortable and bed and room were smaller than portrayed on website I had booked the most expensive room because wanted a little luxury You had to fetch milk for your coffee no tea provided in room or kettle at the end of the hallway The apple juice that I decided to purchase from the mini bar was off ;keamanan;1
 I barely slept as the bed was so hard I could not get comfortable Insisting on taking money from your debit card on top of already having paid for the room or they wont let you in the room With a non refundable booking I was left with no choice but hand over the extra money;keamanan;1
 I booked a specific room at the hotel to get a different experience than the first time we stayed We were upgraded but not told until we asked about the room Felt too awkward saying I didn t want the upgrade so we just took it ;keamanan;1
 I could not make the coffee machine work in the pantry and I was too tired to seek assistance ;keamanan;1
 I expected the superior double room to be slightly larger in size ;keamanan;1
 I had a cleaner knock my door in the Morning just because she wasn t sure if the room was vacant or not ;keamanan;1
 I have asked for a copy of my invoice keamanan times once at the hotel on check out to be sent by email and twice on the contact us section of the hotel web site Nothing has arrived and there has been no response ;keamanan;1
 I have never been able to find fault with this property ;keamanan;1
 I liked the idea of a pantry at the end of the corridor but it meant I couldnt have an early cup of tea in the morning without getting dressed Didnt like to go in dressing gown ;keamanan;1
 I m not sure I would give this hotel 5 stars The reception staff was uneven Some very good others not Housekeeping didn t refresh the minibar or replace glasses ;keamanan;1
 I may as well have slept on a block of concrete It was one of the hardest most uncomfortable beds I ve ever slept in and I wouldn t return for that reason alone ;keamanan;1
 I reported my mother s cane was left behind never received a response from you When leaving another guests suitcase was almost given to us which could have resulted in another customers losing an item;keamanan;1
 I thought the food in the restaurant not a good value ;keamanan;1
 I thought the rooms were a bit small for the money but everything else was fabulous ;keamanan;1
 I was disappointed that there was no sense of the original railway hotel although we did not use the restaurant or bar ;keamanan;1
 I was disappointed when I sent my dress in for dry cleaning and I was in a hurry when we left and placed it in my bag When I got home there were color stains on the dress from the dry cleaning I discovered it too late unfortunately ;keamanan;1
 I was woken at kenyamanan kenyamanankenyamananam as a result of someone yelling loudly and aggressively in the hall outside my room The yelling went on for a while and then the person began to knock and finally to hammer on my door while continuing to yell loudly It was a bit frightening I called reception who said that the police were on their way Not long afterward things quietened down but unfortunately I could not get back to sleep;keamanan;1
 I would have preferred an iron in the room and two gin and tonics were priced at kerapihankenyamanan ;keamanan;1
 If I m being picky I found the lighting in the room quite dull and the view out of the window wasn t good Other than that everything was fine ;keamanan;1
 If not only the coffee machine a kettle for making a cup of tea would be perfect Some rooms if have bigger wardrobes would be another perfect ;keamanan;1
 Impressive price for the room;keamanan;1
 In my room at least there was lack of space and so you couldn t go around the bed ;keamanan;1
 Initially they ve assigned me a room without a shower only with a bathtub which was not comfortable for me but they changed my room immediately to another one with a shower ;keamanan;1
 Ironing facilities in room always useful ;keamanan;1
 It is definitely not 5 Tiny room with no room to move or store clothing Very difficult when kerapihan adults are sharing a room Most uncomfortable night s sleep I have ever had One of the teacakes in the pantry was out of date ;keamanan;1
 It is expensive to stay here Our return to the Great Northern Hotel;keamanan;1
 It was a bit pricey for the location but well worth the service;keamanan;1
 It was a little noises but given the central city location is understandable The sound proofing makes a big difference ;keamanan;1
 It was very expensive and the check in process was very slow;keamanan;1
 Lack of comforts in the room Such as no clock no outlets in bathroom no desk no drawers for clothes no shelf and or table for items near mirror in room and in bathroom ;keamanan;1
 Lack of shower in bathroom;keamanan;1
 Late start to weekend breakfast Disappointing with kenyamanan9kenyamanankenyamanan Eurostar train ;keamanan;1
 Lines at check in could be shorter Great restaurant but difficult to find hidden in hotel ;keamanan;1
 Little pricy at the restaurants and bar;keamanan;1
 Mattress disappointingly uncomfortable;keamanan;1
 Maybe the addition of a small fridge in the room Not much of a view from our room ;keamanan;1
 Minor point but the pillows were too soft so need extra ones in the cupboard ;keamanan;1
 More CAKE;keamanan;1
 More space probably but hey ;keamanan;1
 My only complaint is the standard rooms are very small with very little wardrobe space and no room to store the suitcase This was my second stay on my first trip I was given a complimentary upgrade to a larger room but I was not aware of this until I got the small room on this trip so I was disappointed with the room ;keamanan;1
 My television didn t work and a had to move rooms I was offered free breakfast but I had already paid for it so instead I was given a free drink It was also difficult to find your way in to reception ;keamanan;1
 N A pure perfection;keamanan;1
 Need a magnification mirror in bathroom Coffee machine in pantry is a nightmare to get to work and is always going wrong Could do with another seat ;keamanan;1
 Need a sign saying go right to reception otherwise you have to drag your suitcase up an down a few stairs not needed when you have a heavy suitcases ;keamanan;1
 Need blackout blinds ;keamanan;1
 Needs a deal to be affordable ;keamanan;1
 Nice rooms but poor room layout bathroom night light was a little annoying as the bath room had a glass door which faced the bed Could benefit from more diverse bar snacks olives spiced nuts etc ;keamanan;1
 No a bad experience as such but found the lack of access to both sides of a double bed incovenient during the night You disturb the other sleeper ;keamanan;1
 No bad experience but the public area on the ground floor with reception and bar was smaller than I expected This did not really affect our stay Will definitely use again ;keamanan;1
 No bad experiences Toilet in room wasn t as clean as it should have been but otherwise kebersihankenyamanankenyamanan ;keamanan;1
 No bath in my room;keamanan;1
 No bath same cake each day in pantry no where to sit with kebersihankeamanan year old eg lobby for hot chocolate in evening;keamanan;1
 No chair in the room ;keamanan;1
 No closet space we did not need it for a night but would have been a drawback for a longer stay ;keamanan;1
 No comfy chair to sit on in the room just a stool which I put against the wall to lean back The bed was very high and was a bit difficult for me with being short and stiff hip But great comfort for sleeping ;keamanan;1
 No drawer space no problem for overnight stays or business people ;keamanan;1
 No drawers and limited space for hanging clothes Breakfast was good but expensive Nice to have a Nespresso machine but there was no milk in the room yet there was a minibar fridge Had to get a mug of milk from another fridge along the corridor Also only one stick of sugar a bit mean ;keamanan;1
 No drop off place so had to park a few kebersihankenyamanankenyamanan yards away and carry bags rather than drop off in front of hotel and then park ;keamanan;1
 No emailed invoice to follow as promised on check out Also my customers have complained that the 5kenyamanan per authorisation was taken from their card and told it would not be retured for 5 kebersihankenyamanan days which is not right ;keamanan;1
 No kettle in individual room a cup of tea is needed to walk through a long corridor to the pantry just think that when you get up in the morning you have to get changed for that cup of tea ;keamanan;1
 No kettle in room to make a cup of tea in the morning Coffee machine in room but no kettle Bed very high and awkward to get in and out of ;keamanan;1
 No kettle tea in the room In Britain Coffee maker only For tea one needs to leave the room and wander to the kitchen at the end of the corridor Room itself odd shaped the bed covered the entire window no space to walk around the bed at all The floor of the bathroom was either dirty or the material simply doesn t clean well ;keamanan;1
 No pool gym;keamanan;1
 NO SHOWER WATER ALL OVER THE PLACE SILLY IDEA trying to shower with hand held shower spray;keamanan;1
 No tea coffee making in room worse thing was having to climb over the wife to go to th bathroom in the night was like a comedy sketch bed really uncomfortable room very very small considering price was over kerapihan5kenyamanan not good enough;keamanan;1
 No tea making facilities in room Were lucky to be near parlour but if not would have been inconvenient;keamanan;1
 No tea provided in the room only coffee ;keamanan;1
 No view as looked out onto domed roof;keamanan;1
 No water in pantry and bottle of water expensive;keamanan;1
 Noise noise noise;keamanan;1
 Not a bad experience but would have preferred tea making facilities in room not down the corridor II;keamanan;1
 Not a bad experience just a little diasppointed I had not fully understood the size of the couchette room After all it does show a table and chairs on the webpage for the room so an assumption it would be snug but somewhere to sit at least No Only on the bed and for two people even at a special price not really worth the money to be honest My husband was there with me and we danced around each other trying to get dressed and ready to go out A beautiful hotel but seriously these rooms should be sold to solo travellers ;keamanan;1
 Not a great selection of TV channels;keamanan;1
 Not a lot of room to move about in ;keamanan;1
 not a lot the evening meal was very good perhaps a little expensive for us normal people but worth it we even had a case problem before we left samsone round the corner fixed this and you kept our case for a week well done ;keamanan;1
 Not able to make a cup of tea in my room first thing in the morning and had to get dressed to go to the pantry at the end of the hallway ;keamanan;1
 Not bad but when busy restaurant is very loud and hard to hear yourself talk Need tea making facility and kettle for weary travellers as well as coffee and small milk supply of some type Some wine as option in room Facility to iron clothes without having to refer to staff all the time More improvement than a gripe ;keamanan;1
 Not being able to walk around the bed We were offered the option of a superior room for an additional kenyamanankenyamanan but declined because we were departing before 6 am the following day ;keamanan;1
 Not changing the bed sheets each day Inadequate hanging space for clothes room lighting poor for a dark room and bed side cabinets had sharp handle edges that could inflict an injury Entrance to the hotel is tiny easy to miss and uninviting ;keamanan;1
 Not enough water in room Would have liked more of a selection and extra water to have been in the pantry ;keamanan;1
 not many communal areas apart from bar and restaurant ;keamanan;1
 Not much of a view from the room Just the roof of Kings X station;keamanan;1
 Not sure whether it was us or not but the cold water tap in the bathroom ran hot Very odd ;keamanan;1
 Nothing A really nice stay ;keamanan;1
 Nothing it s just perfect;keamanan;1
 Nothing light at all on the room service menu ;keamanan;1
 On booking with Booking com I requested If possible a bath we were allocated room kebersihankenyamanankerapihan which has a lovely free standing bath Unfortunately the hot water supply was poor lukewarm slow delivery so that the bath was unusable The concierge tried to remedy the situation to no avail so that even in the morning we had poor ineffective supply To give credit where due as a result of this problem the duty manager waived all charges for our stay ;keamanan;1
 On Sunday morning the restaurant was crowded The food was grade one less than every morning ;keamanan;1
 One small thing the courtesy lights in the bathroom was a bit bright and kept me awake but I am a light sleeper ;keamanan;1
 Only there one night and have no didn t likes ;keamanan;1
 Others have already mentioned a couple of points and I heard another customer raising them when checking out too I think both need to be considered kebersihan the bathroom has patterned glass in the doors as well as a gap where the two half doors almost meet in the centre As such the bathroom doesn t offer very much privacy sound or vision especially as rooms are quite small Adding a curtain across would be a simple and valuable touch kerapihan the hotel often has an event wedding held there This is fine and the hotel is very quiet however guests are not told until arrival that this means the bar and restaurant are closed to guests earlier than usual so you can t drink or eat there I understand why but we could and should be told earlier so other plans can be made ;keamanan;1
 Pantry system ;keamanan;1
 Poor value for money The room was extremely small and cramped This was even after paying for an upgrade The snacks consisted of Luke warm coffee biscuits cake and jelly babies Not worth the money ;keamanan;1
 Pretty expensive but then again it is London and I live in Yorkshire;keamanan;1
 Prices of the drinks in the bar One gin tonic one small beer was kebersihan7 Definitely would never buy a drink there again ;keamanan;1
 Really small bed for two persons Used cup with juice inside my room after my check in;keamanan;1
 Reception failed to explain to my wife how to use the room key to access the locked corridor leading to confusion and irritation on arriving late in the evening However the staff immediately apologised for the error with the offer of a complimentary drink which we did require but appreciated as an acknowledgement of that had occurred ;keamanan;1
 Reception is so unobtrusive as to make the arrival process confusing and underwhelming Paid nearly as much as I did at the Renaissance across the road when last staying in the area and there is no comparison dus to the level of attention to detail for example my room had chipped paint a stained desk blotter similar hallmarks of a high volume room the St Pancras Renaissance allows no such things I m afraid that if I were staying in the area again and on a similar budget I d opt for the Renaissance I d go to the GN bar again though ;keamanan;1
 Reception was undersized for property Entrance was too discreet with little signage esp within lobby ;keamanan;1
 restaurants booked up til late by the time we arrived at 7 p m ;keamanan;1
 Resturnt didn t live up to the exspectauon or prices charged Dinner for one 8kenyamanan the standard should be better Sorry but the decor doesn t make a restaurant ;keamanan;1
 Room kebersihankenyamanan9 was a single with a double bed totally unsuitable for an elderly couple Charged as a double it was a contravention of the advertising standards legislation ;keamanan;1
 Room a little small but was very well laid out and still had everything you would need ;keamanan;1
 Room a tad small but is a small boutique hotel ;keamanan;1
 Room and shower room are great;keamanan;1
 Room cleaning and poor service from reservation desk ;keamanan;1
 Room far to small;keamanan;1
 Room interior detailed design was very poor and clearly done and approved by people with no eye for detail Lots of little things could be much improved ;keamanan;1
 Room is a little too small so I can t arrange my luggage in a good way ;keamanan;1
 Room is cramped and this was supposedly a Deluxe room Also the rooms are DARK even with all available lights on ;keamanan;1
 Room not ready till kenyamananpm offered complimentary drink and free breakfast but would of been disappointed if I had paid Not worth kerapihan5 Service excellent though No tea making facilities in room but were available along the corridor with complimentary cakes For a King room could just squeeze past wall to get into far side of bed and bathroom too close to bed for any privacy when using toilet;keamanan;1
 Room service staff knocked on door after cleaning the room to check if the room is cleaned One day after the room was cleaned i was in the bathroom and the room service manger knocked the door and she entered while i am in the bathroom;keamanan;1
 Room size does not allow for chairs which would have been appreciated after an afternoon in London and before going out at night Bathroom doors could have offered more privacy ;keamanan;1
 Room size is small ;keamanan;1
 Room size Way too small for two adults;keamanan;1
 Room tiny had to climb over partner to get in out of bed Public areas over crowded therefore nowhere to sit ;keamanan;1
 Room very little ;keamanan;1
 Room was a bit small and the price for breakfast was crazy;keamanan;1
 Room was a bit small thought this is a very minor complaint ;keamanan;1
 Room was only big enough for a single bed yet a double bed was pushed up against the side wall making it extremely difficult for one person to get out of bed ;keamanan;1
 Room was small with little storage Check in area also very small so gets crowded easily ;keamanan;1
 Room was too hot Getting almost too expensive;keamanan;1
 Room was very nice but quite small The room was also not very lit;keamanan;1
 Room was very small Nowhere to sit that was quiet and we could relax Bars were VERY noisy ;keamanan;1
 room wasn t ready at kebersihankenyamanan keamanankenyamananpm had to wait kebersihankenyamanan minutes for a room with a shower very long wait for breakfast kerapihan5 minutes for hot drinks and another kerapihankenyamanan mins for breakfast the waitress had forgotten us Very small room;keamanan;1
 Rooms are a bit dark In house dining not as convenient ;keamanan;1
 Rooms are a touch small ;keamanan;1
 Rooms are on the small side and there is no real desk to work at ;keamanan;1
 Rooms are pokey but they ve done an excellent job with the structure they have so as long as you go understanding that there s no cat swinging room then you ll really enjoy For me the finishing pantry facility more than made up for it being a small room Hell you re in the heart of London so who needs a big room ;keamanan;1
 Rooms are small and hotel is lifeless unless you want to hang around the bar ;keamanan;1
 rooms can be a little small and pokey especially the toilets in some rooms;keamanan;1
 Rooms could have been a little bigger and no proper wardrobes;keamanan;1
 Rooms rather small and compact Expensive;keamanan;1
 Rooms small if stay in room;keamanan;1
 Rooms Very tight Athough perfectly kept and very nicely decorated the space was extremely small relative to the price being charged We had a Cubitt room so one of the larger rooms and still had the toilet literally kerapihan feet from the head of our bed This was our first stay in London so don t have much to compare to but for price of room would have expected larger footprint Restaurant We were running late one morning and so decided to have breakfast in the Plum and Spilt Milk onsite restaurant The total invoice for a breakfast for four and nothing extravagant was ordered regular eggs and bacon was a little over kebersihankenyamanankenyamanan pounds The environments was nice but certainly not worth the extra lift on the invoice Food was fine but value was not there for what we experienced and left a very bad taste in our mouths so to speak in terms of value overall So to sum up way too expensive for what was offered We have stayed in some very posh hotels in our travels and this one breakfast was one to remember for not the right reasons We chose to go elsewhere for the remainder of our stay ;keamanan;1
 Rooms were a bit small and it was all very pricey ;keamanan;1
 Rooms whilst very nice are on small side and not many places to hang clothes;keamanan;1
 Sadly I would like to go back but it would probably be as kerapihan adults and kebersihan child and they don t have a room to cater for that which would mean I would have to use an other hotel instead of paying for kerapihan rooms Perhaps they could add a extra bed in the premium rooms to Cater for kebersihan child;keamanan;1
 Sadly the room had no opening window thecore no fresh air It did of course have air conditioning ;keamanan;1
 Sheets blankets in the summer a duvet is far too hot even with the air con going full blast But this happens everywhere ;keamanan;1
 Shower needed instructions and door opened inwards which made it very difficult to get in A large person might not make it Needs a waste paper basket in room and a desk or less precarious table ;keamanan;1
 size of bedrooms;keamanan;1
 Size of the room And no Bath tub in the bathroom For its room rate this is very poor After a long day s travel do they not think soaking in the warm bath can really make a difference Power shower may be fashionable but with the popularity of the spa treatment in this country they should consider some people especially women appreciate a nice bath time ;keamanan;1
 Slow breakfast service Very fatty bacon ;keamanan;1
 Slow check in and check out Room very small;keamanan;1
 Small pokey room Very expensive Poor restaurant Not very polite staff;keamanan;1
 Some staff seem a little too stiff ;keamanan;1
 Staff could have told us it was an accessible room ;keamanan;1
 Staff not very friendly and reception area very small;keamanan;1
 Standard room was tiny OK for a night or two for one person only I will book again but will know to reserve a larger room ;keamanan;1
 standard rooms are small and view of the kings cross station dome ;keamanan;1
 Superior room too small for the price;keamanan;1
 That I was only there for one night ;keamanan;1
 That we weren t able to walk around the bed The person near the wall had to climb over the other person to get in or out of bed ;keamanan;1
 The area of the room was small for what we paid ;keamanan;1
 The bar has been ruined by three massive TV screens drinks were a little disappointing and the great railway prints removed to make way for mediocre art Definitely some missteps since it was taken over that need arresting ;keamanan;1
 The bars are frightfully expensive you d pay just as much for cocktails in a premium West End Knightsbridge hotel for shorts cocktails ;keamanan;1
 The bathroom did not have a shower only a bath which is somewhat inconvenient ;keamanan;1
 The bathroom doors a little too transparent when using toilet ;keamanan;1
 The bathroom is only equipped with a bath no shower and thus it is somewhat tricky to have a quick shower The floor ends up very wet as there is no shower curtain but overall thats okay The noise from cars outside The hotel is isolated from all the station sounds announcements trains but our window was facing the road which was quite noisy even at night with all the buses ;keamanan;1
 The beakfast service is quite slow not enough staff ;keamanan;1
 The bed and pillows When I book a room that is very important to me ;keamanan;1
 The bed is absolutelly unconfortable ;keamanan;1
 the bed was pushed up against the window so not easy to manoeuvre around with the bench at the end of it;keamanan;1
 The bed was too high and it was not possible to walk around it A sophisticated coffee making machine was provided in the room but no ordinary kettle We did not like the ribbed glass door to the bathroom It lacked a feeling of privacy We thought keamanankerapihankenyamanan for one night without breakfast was rather expensive ;keamanan;1
 The bedroom was TINY I have never stayed in a hotel before where you can only get in the bed on one side as the other side buts up against the wall ;keamanan;1
 The bottles being emptied into a bin at 6kebersihan5am;keamanan;1
 The breakfast service was very slow and the staff although nice were not as attentive as I would have expected for that standard of hotel We had to ask for the bill kenyamanan times and ended up rushing to catch our train;keamanan;1
 The breakfast was entirely false advertising Selection of fruit was green apples and red apples I cake NO bread no toaster No croissants bagels nothing ;keamanan;1
 The entertainment system was flaky and the remote wouldn t work from our bed ;keamanan;1
 The entrance needs to be more clearly marked with a sign inside pointing to reception Upstairs the corridors are spacious whereas the bedrooms are tiny especially for two They are not designed for couples travelling with suitcases ;keamanan;1
 The entrance to the hotel seems hidden I wandered around for a few minutes trying to work out where the front door was The welcome was lukewarm ;keamanan;1
 The gentleman in front of us to check in was given a triple room I pgrade We checked in a second after it was my partners keamanankenyamananth birthday and we were given kebersihan complimentary drink kerapihan kebersihan for each of us would ve been nice ;keamanan;1
 The hippo in my bath;keamanan;1
 THE LIGHT IN BATHROOM ON ALL NIGHT ROOM VERY SMALL;keamanan;1
 The lobby entrance of the hotel is not very welcoming The carpets were dirty;keamanan;1
 The main bar area was fitting in design with the hotel but the atmosphere didn t sync with the hotel s classy and elegant vibe the choice of music was clubby and was so loud that it made it impossible to hold an intimate conversation Wouldn t stop me from staying at this hotel again but I d give the bar a miss and seek out other more intimate and cozy venues ;keamanan;1
 the mirrors could have been better cleaned for being a 5 star hotel;keamanan;1
 The only minor point was that the bed was only accessible from one side which made access a bit difficult had to crawl over my partner to get in and out ;keamanan;1
 the only possible complaint might be the view of a roof But everything else was so good it paled into insignificance Besides you can t do much about the view ;keamanan;1
 The only thing that i possibly could pick on was that it wasnt completely apparent that the front door of the hotel was actually the front door ;keamanan;1
 The only thing would be clearer signing to direct you to the Reception Desk from the entrance door;keamanan;1
 The other ill mannered guests;keamanan;1
 The pantry wasn t quite what we expected Wasn t topped up with fresh cakes etc Just had some sweets and mince pies on offer ;keamanan;1
 The photos of the room booked did not represent the real space In the end it was much smaller ;keamanan;1
 The pillows were too soft for my liking Even piling up all four didn t help ;keamanan;1
 The positioning of the bed against the window meant that the room was ideal for a single occupant but not for a couple;keamanan;1
 the price will have to save up before we can return;keamanan;1
 The provision of toiletries was inadequate and we did not like the lack of space in the room we had booked so had to upgrade Frankly overpriced for what you get even though the location is very good;keamanan;1
 The reception area is small and crowded for a hotel of this category We got a complementary upgrade to a bigger room This was sized as expected which means normal rooms must be small There is no proper walk in shower but a large bath tub instead with a shower but this is not a good solution as one can slip and water can go everywhere If you are close to the kitchen which we were there will be noise at night Facilities are very basic It is not clear how they got five stars or what that implies for the difference between keamanan kenyamanan and 5 stars We did not mind but it is not so clear how they can justify the price charged The breakfast is too expensive in particular as it is not at all difficult to get very good quality breakfast very close by So we did not book it ;keamanan;1
 The reception is rather tucked away and having to negotiate a busy car can be intimidating for a solo traveller ;keamanan;1
 The restaurant while it is now one of the best in London has become very expensive The breakfast is truly excellent but really doesn t justify its price ;keamanan;1
 The room and bathroom very small and the carpet in the room must be changed No space for my clothes ;keamanan;1
 The room as beautiful as it was was quite small ;keamanan;1
 The room didn t get very dark the emergency green light reflects off the mirrors which was irritating ;keamanan;1
 The room in the attic on the fifth floor was miniscule Two people cannot walk round the room in opposite directions No wardrobe one tiny cupboard to hang clothes a gents dress shirt will be rubbing on the floor when hung up No drawers you will be living out of your suitcase the whole stay No bath shower only ;keamanan;1
 The room is a bit small but it still really nice;keamanan;1
 The room is rather archly described as a couchette This means that however compact the design there is no room to swing a cat I had arranged to meet a friend at the hotel and we could barely pass each other in the room and had to take tea standing in the pantry For the same price around kerapihan5kenyamanan GBP you get a spacious room at The St Pancras Renaissance On the other hand the staff at the Great Northern make you feel more welcome ;keamanan;1
 The Room Service breakfast was disappointing wrong coffees and items missing Slow service ;keamanan;1
 the room was a little small for the price ;keamanan;1
 The room was a little smaller than I had expected however it had everything I needed ;keamanan;1
 The room was a tad on the small side but the en suite made up for it ;keamanan;1
 The room was abit small and cramped but I can understand that it is common here at such good location But both the bedside tables were really tiny with limited surface space to put personal items needed during sleep The lighting was dim while its romantic and good for some it s annoying when extra lighting was needed The wifi was unstable and hard to be connected I had to repeatedly log in while using it in the room and most of the time I had to use my own data roaming The reception was really helpful but there was nothing much they can do about the wifi ;keamanan;1
 The room was tiny literally a cupboard and very very expensive;keamanan;1
 The room was very small and the toilet cistern run all night Very limited on space to keep your clothes Being on the 5th floor there was no view from the window ;keamanan;1
 The rooms are small and there was a bath instead of a shower ;keamanan;1
 The rooms could have been a bit bigger and it is a shame that you do not have a gym or health centre;keamanan;1
 The rooms were tiny I specifically upgraded to the slightly larger rooms on the top floor The issue is that the top floor has a slanted roof and the room is already tiny so it really feels like a room for hobbits The images of the rooms on the website are actually renderings so it s an inaccurate representation of the room Also there wasn t really a view of anything except the roof of the train station for us which was a shame ;keamanan;1
 The rude guests but this cannot be avoided ;keamanan;1
 The same room rate did not include breakfast The big mirror above the bed headboard Narrow doorway at room entrance ;keamanan;1
 The service charge and the room rate which was approx 5 more than reasonable for the weekend;keamanan;1
 The shower did not heat up and it was too hot in the room But we are confident that if had had the time to wait the shower would have been put right and the night receptionist was able to override the room thermometer ;keamanan;1
 The shower floor was slippery and felt dangerous ;keamanan;1
 The size of the room was very disappointing for the price;keamanan;1
 The standard rooms are for those prices minute the hotel itself describes them as couchettes which considering they contain a bed and precious little else is a better description While I realise that this hotel is in central London the rooms compared to other hotels are overpriced Room service up to kebersihankebersihan p m only a la carte dishes from the restaurant again an expensive option ;keamanan;1
 There s no hot water served inside the room you have to go out to the pantry for a cup of tea it s really not convenient ;keamanan;1
 There was a light in the bathroom under the sink that we couldn t turn out ;keamanan;1
 There was a lot of light from the outside which made it hard to sleep and very oddly a floor level light in the bathroom that we couldn t work out how to switch off The doors from the bathroom are glass so this was a bit of a problem the light was quite bright So make sure to take an eyeshade Staff were helpful and friendly but seemed rushed and a bit short on help The room wasn t ready when I arrived at kenyamanan keamanankenyamanan although I was given a free drink while I waited It also took some time for my bag to be brought up to the room This isn t what you expect from a hotel of that quality and price ;keamanan;1
 There was a misleading issue when checking in where they said my card was declined I had to use a different card Once I had called the bank in the morning they said nothing was wrong with the card and nothing was declined so for a while I was under the impression I had been charged twice and resolving this issue could have been dealt with in a clearer matter by hotel staff ;keamanan;1
 There was no milk in the fridge for coffee and the pantry was being cleaned so staff wouldnt let me make one I concede that the pantry has to be cleaned and it was unfortunate timing It would not deter me from staying again ;keamanan;1
 They addressed a relatively minor issue I had superbly I was really impressed by their customer service ;keamanan;1
 They seem to not have bell boys which means the front desk chaps have to help you move heavy bags They are happy to do so just wish they had proper baggage assistance ;keamanan;1
 This didn t detract from our stay but did want to leave a warning for American s booking the room with a king sized bed by American sizes this is actually a queen bed ;keamanan;1
 This time I booked a King Room I was only there one night and was given a small double room The reception tried to tell me that this was a King size in the UK where I ve lived all my life and I do know what a King bed is found it a bit of a condescending excuse and as I was there only one night and tired I didn t escalate it but it did annoy me and probably won t go back due to this An apology would have been totally acceptable if they didn t have the room I booked available Honesty is the best policy ;keamanan;1
 Tiny room almost no hanging space no ironing board ;keamanan;1
 Tiny understaffed reception area for a 5 star hotel When attempting to organise luggage drop off from rental car reservations were unable to transfer a call to reception and reception simply did not answer their number ;keamanan;1
 Too expensive and they didn t have the room I had booked Breakfast was disappointing ;keamanan;1
 Too many light switches in the bedroom and confusing as to what switched what Also the room was too dark ;keamanan;1
 too many steps in reception small entrance for managing cases however porter very helpful ;keamanan;1
 Trying to find the way in when we arrived at kerapihankeamanan kenyamanankenyamanan;keamanan;1
 U K King size bed is Not as big as an Australian king size bed;keamanan;1
 Unfortunately because the room was located on the 5th floor near the door leading to the lifts it was very loud when shutting everytime someone came into the corridor I probably woke several times during the night because of this If the door shutting mechanism could be adjusted so it was quieter when closing it would make a big difference to anyone sleeping in the room ;keamanan;1
 value;keamanan;1
 Very odd finding the lift We re given a disabled room and told there were no others then I rang down and said I was not happy and suddenly there was another room Should really be given the option at booking especially as this was a no refundable room ;keamanan;1
 Very poor value for money;keamanan;1
 Very poor value for money I booked in early June and was given a disabled room staff spoke poor english;keamanan;1
 Very small bed room although I had paid extra to upgrade to a deluxe room with a King size bed this was not as big as the king size at home ;keamanan;1
 Very small reception which was hard to find if you hadn t been there before Noisy throughout the night with returning guests Managed only kerapihan hours of sleep Reception staff informed on our departure but they weren t particularly bothered ;keamanan;1
 Very small room not too much space at 6 kenyamanan;keamanan;1
 Was disappointed with the food in the restaurant Expected better for the price ;keamanan;1
 Was hard to find entrance;keamanan;1
 We booked a standard double room The room was very small but the bed even smaller It was only kebersihanmkeamanan5 wide The room was so small that both persons had to get into the bed from the same side The bed was certainly too small for two standard persons When I told the reception the answer was that next time I had to book a superior room The very small bathroom was also very cold The heating in the bathroom was not working while it was freezing outside For all this we payed kerapihankenyamanan9 without breakfast Never again ;keamanan;1
 We didn t like the fact that our room didn t have a seating area apart from a small seat at the desk so had to sit ON the bed to relax or watch TV This was not very clear in the room description Also a very small amount of hanging space ;keamanan;1
 We dined in the hotel restaurant and thought the prices were a high because of the optional service charges for the bar and restaurant ;keamanan;1
 We have stayed at the property previously and enjoyed our experience however the one item of disappointment is the cost Usually you can expect to pay between kebersihankenyamanankenyamanan kebersihan5kenyamanan GBP per night however on this occasion the property we assume as the stay crossed over valentines day was charging kerapihankeamanankenyamanan GBP which was an excessive uplift On arrival we went to our room which was a standard category to find that it was tiny The room only fit a double bed and bedside desk One side of the bed was against the wall and window so you would have to climb over your partner to get out of bed or to the bathroom and the foot of the bed was against the wall Although they tried to romanticise the room as innovatively designed and reminiscent of old sleeper cabins it was far too small to be comfortable or functionable This meant changing rooms and paying an additional 5kenyamananGBP kerapihan8kenyamananGBP total to be able to walk around either side of the bed in a room that was of a standard hotel size Very disappointing ;keamanan;1
 We only stayed kebersihan night and found nothing to complain about ;keamanan;1
 We only stayed one night but the standard double room though beautifully finished is quite small and had no place to sit other than on the bed which might not be great if you re planning a longer trip ;keamanan;1
 We went for brunch the next morning to the restaurant only to be told that we could sit in the bar or down stairs as they were fully booked We opted for the bar and stayed kebersihan hour whilst we ate The restaurant during this whole time was only at half capacity That aside the food was amazing I highly recommend the crab and avocado on toast THE BEST;keamanan;1
 We were expecting a bigger room as I had booked a superior double room ;keamanan;1
 We were given a disabled room and were not informed before of this before we were shown to our room The bed was advertised to us as a large double bed but was a queen bed and felt that the website was misleading ;keamanan;1
 We would have liked some drawers to put sweaters in It would have been nice if the bar would serve croissants with their coffee in the morning ;keamanan;1
 Went to have a meal at the Plum and Spilt Milk in the hotel the food was nice however ordered a drink from the bar noticed the rim of the glass was chipped leaving a sharp edge flagged it up the waiter didn t seem to be concerned Not a reaction I would have expected from an established restaurant Not sure I m in a hurry to return for dinner there ;keamanan;1
 when I came to check in with the booking I had made they told me they didnt have a room they said booking com had sold me a room when the hotel was full The truth is that they sold my room for more money than I had paid due to high demand The two idiots on the tiny reception were clueless and couldnt care a toss they didnt try to help in any shape or form but the bar manager was fantastic much more professional in offering us a drink on the house even he remarked that my treatment was terrible ;keamanan;1
 Would have been useful to have an explanation of what all the switches in the room were for ;keamanan;1
 Would have liked a kettle and iron in the room;keamanan;1
 Would hv prefered a guard standing near entrance for security at night especially that the hotels location is delicate;keamanan;1
 kebersihan Although the hotel has spa in its name the spa itself was very weak We ordered aroma theropy but in fact it was not so keamanan out of 5 marks kerapihan The so called landmark view of the room selected was not really so perfect to see nice views of Barcelona It was a room with view on the street Do not know what is offered with standart view keamanan Breakfast was quite good in term of options but very expensive in term of price per person kenyamanan Some staff members does not know English very well We ordered Jasmine tea but received mint tea in the bar 5 We expected to have nice romantic dinner at the hotel with live music but was surprised to hear that there is no such option in the hotel ;keamanan;1
 kebersihan free wifi speed is very slow kerapihan room did not specify clearly there is window is facing to back yard ;keamanan;1
 kerapihannd bedroom was tiny and really too small for kerapihan teenagers to share Although we were left soap and loo roll a small welcome pack of salt pepper olive oil sugar etc could have been useful and although there was a nespresso machine we had to go and buy capsules again a few to get you going would be good ;keamanan;1
 keamanan7 for The parking spot is a bit expensive And The breakfast was 5kenyamanan not like its noticed in The booking com keamanan5 ;keamanan;1
 Abril at reception was not particularly helpful towards us as tired travelers and trying to meet our needs but the rest of the staff were fantastic particularly Marc at the concierge desk ;keamanan;1
 All the top ;keamanan;1
 Always have to ask for complimentary water very small supply was provided ;keamanan;1
 Ants in the room Shower in kebersihan bathroom did not work;keamanan;1
 Apartment was not in the hotel building itself it was in another building accross the street which is not mentioned in booking website No helpdesk in the building you feel somehow is not secured Bedrooms looks like its keamanan stars hotel Cleaning the apartment charge was not included in the booking rate even if you leave your garbage outside the apartment no one will remove it You have to take kerapihan lifts to reach the ground floor The stairs are too close from the left door kids might fall;keamanan;1
 Apartments might need more attention to be 5 star but the hotel itself is very worthy of the stars ;keamanan;1
 As I mentioned above I did not like looking out the hotel window to a cement wall outside ;keamanan;1
 Barcelona as a city is not a safe place at all i hate everythingthere i will not visit it again;keamanan;1
 Basic rooms well equipped but a little small;keamanan;1
 Bed could have been better but was basically European standard ;keamanan;1
 Beds were a bit small ;keamanan;1
 Bedside tables no drawers Lighting for reading inadequate Desk but no chest of drawers inadequate space for clothing;keamanan;1
 Booked a Queen room and the bed was separated upon arrival Had to call the front desk and housekeeper had to come and make bed into a queen These things should be done before guest arrives No wifi for the last couple of days This is a non smoking hotel yet there would be cigarette smell coming through the ventilation system several times a day making the whole room smell like an ash tray I was expecting more from a hotel with this caracter ;keamanan;1
 Breakfast and baveradges are very expansive Swimming pool is very small more like a bath ;keamanan;1
 breakfast in the price needed indoor pool in January;keamanan;1
 Breakfast quality of hot foods was lacking Stale pancakes and waffles Soggy scrambled eggs Really good if continental style options are what you like but eggs were so sad and hot breakfast needs make over ;keamanan;1
 breakfast too expensive and the spa was disappointing for the quality and size of hotel ;keamanan;1
 But I had two under five year olds with me and the window was not safe at all It s relatively easy to open and there s no safety after that If you re in the bathroom and your child opens the window God forbid that s super dangerous Also if you re using a stroller there are stairs even in the corridor of our floor itself so it s a hassle lifting up and down ;keamanan;1
 Can t think of anything as it was perfect ;keamanan;1
 Change the brand of Amenity;keamanan;1
 Charge for everything in minibar No regular coffee in room ;keamanan;1
 Check in ;keamanan;1
 Cleaning once per week in the apartments;keamanan;1
 coffee service in the room was not refreshed after the first day we stayed 7 nights;keamanan;1
 Concierge not helpful but guest relations staff excellent ;keamanan;1
 Could have been a few more mirrors in the flat;keamanan;1
 Didn t know before we arrived that there was no maid service but could pay extra if wanted Also breakfast excellent but very expensive as extra;keamanan;1
 Didn t like the shower but rest is perfect;keamanan;1
 Disappointed that apartments were completely cut off from the hotel you didn t get the feel of staying in a hotel so felt we didn t get to appreciate the full value of the hotel;keamanan;1
 Er the prices in hotel were a little excessive but I must say offset by the service surroundings and smiles from staff;keamanan;1
 Everything was perfect but we would have loved some tea in the morning there was only the Nespresso available Only a minor point though;keamanan;1
 Food and drink seemed a little expensive but probably in line with a five star city hotel It seemed a bit tricky to use the pool as it seems like a restaurant with a pool in it we went up to the roof for a drink which was lovely and the views are stunning but would have felt awkward swimming there Certainly wouldn t want to have turned up in swimwear with a towel ;keamanan;1
 Food choice at the bar;keamanan;1
 Food wasn t amazing but we didn t eat loads so may have just been our choice ;keamanan;1
 For keamanankenyamanankenyamanan a night I expect more Our room was smaller than the cruise ship stateroom we had just left and looked out on an airshaft The promised pool is a small plunge pool on the roof with a beautiful view but water was not heated on a very cool October evening so we did not swim We requested twin beds but discovered a king too late the first night to change it They did fix this for the second night The wi fi was down the whole keamanan days of our stay ;keamanan;1
 Frankly there is nothing I didn t like Everything was good specially the staff ;keamanan;1
 Good but far from catlonya square;keamanan;1
 I booked kerapihan bed apartment which is in different location around kebersihankenyamanankenyamanan meter from the hotel old furniture not clean the apartment full of Ants in the beds bathrooms in the kitchen and simple thing not available like a pen or notes the hotel management very poor in the customer service careless not recommended ;keamanan;1
 I felt that a small carton of milk should have been provided in the apartment The cost via room service was very expensive indeed;keamanan;1
 I like it all in all;keamanan;1
 I think when we make a reservation by booking they provide a poor room ;keamanan;1
 I was a returning guest for 5 nights this trip and the only thing that I had unfortunate experience with was that there was a problem with the water heating system where the water temeperature would change drastically from hot to cold vice Versace while I was under the shower I explained that to the reception after my first night and came back that same day being informed that it has been taken care of BUT the same thing happened the following day So for kerapihan nights showering was very inconvenient for me in that room My room was changed I was upgraded with thanx to the Majestic Staff but still I had to repack unpack again for the remaining keamanan nights which was very time consuming very inconvenient for me ;keamanan;1
 I wouldve liked a higher floor but i didnt matter as much Enjoyed the stay ;keamanan;1
 If I had one complaint it would be that there are not many options for eating IN the hotel We did have the buffet breakfast and found it to be lacking and on the expensive side But there are so many options within a block or two that this is truly a small issue ;keamanan;1
 If you are coming from a place where 5 star hotels are very extravagant and very spacious such as Dubai Abu Dhabi you will be a bit uncomfortable and disappointed by how small the rooms are Rooms are quite small But I guess this is normal in Europe All in all If you are staying for few days you will adopt to the area and the space will grow into you and it will become of no issue ;keamanan;1
 It s directly in the city so if you don t like the sounds of a busy city do not select a city view room ;keamanan;1
 It was a little expensive given that I traveled in off season The rooms were very small Also there was lot of outside noise in the room Too much traffic disturbance all night ;keamanan;1
 It was expensive but being able to self cater was a bonus ;keamanan;1
 Like every other nice hotel breakfast is very expensive if not included But this is minor compared to all the virtues of the majestic hotel ;keamanan;1
 limited wardrobe in my room the rooms for the family were apart from each other though in the same floor ;keamanan;1
 Location as the view from the windows is on service roof that makes the price of the suite is on the higher side;keamanan;1
 Minor issues like not receiving water daily and once the concierge failed to book dinner reservations after promising to do so ;keamanan;1
 Minor quibbles none of which take away from this being one of the finest lodging of my life kebersihan Calling the front desk was a nuisance it would ring kerapihankenyamanan times before someone answered kerapihan The in room guide said towels would be changed on request and no daily housekeeping was included When we met our housekeeper in the hall he told us he d tried to get in every day but we had the no service sign up Had we known a freshening up was included we d have handled it differently keamanan Unlike some other flats they throw out all the leftover guest items tea coffee salt pepper napkins etc So when you move in there s nothing in the cabinets from prior guests ;keamanan;1
 More care could be taken by the interior decorator e g somewhere to put the soap in the shower a reading light by every bed The walls and doors had a bit too many scratches send a painter there;keamanan;1
 My room was smaller and much darker than my friend s room with whom we paid the same and reserved the same room type My room was at kebersihanst floor hers was at kerapihannd Next time I will make sure at the time of the reservation about kerapihannd floor or above especially if I pay the same with the ones at kerapihannd floor or above ;keamanan;1
 No clean towels and no room clean even tho they said it would be done once during our stay ;keamanan;1
 No issues at all really Apartment was not ready even though the system showed it was so bellman Eloy very nice took us back to Reception where they kindly made a hotel room available so we could rest while they finished cleaning So they turned even a small inconvenience into a plus ;keamanan;1
 No kettle in the room and an espresso machine where you had to pay for each capsule really mean for a hotel of this standard;keamanan;1
 No late check out possible even for kebersihan hour ;keamanan;1
 No more rooms were available ;keamanan;1
 No reception in the apartments building;keamanan;1
 No reception security on Residence Building Parking Charge they get already premium for apartment i believe You dont understand your booking not seeing street they charge premium for street view we were looking to back of the building;keamanan;1
 No slippers no bathrobes I would expect them at a 5 star hotel even if it was an apartment;keamanan;1
 Noise from the street due to poor insulation We got a tiny little room in the second floor where we didn t feel comfortable at all For kenyamanankenyamanankenyamanan night without breakfast this felt like a trap ;keamanan;1
 Noise very bad noise isolation from poor quality of windows ;keamanan;1
 not cleaning the appartment every day ;keamanan;1
 Nothin to mintion;keamanan;1
 Nothing Nothing Nothing;keamanan;1
 Nothing to complain about We didn t eat in the hotel not even breakfast which would have been kerapihan9 EUR ;keamanan;1
 Nothing worth mentioning perhaps a more lively lobby where more is happening ;keamanan;1
 Of course there are always some very subjective aspects that can be more perfect but nothing that is generally relevant i e the range of cocktails offered in the ground floor bar ;keamanan;1
 Old fashion furniture ;keamanan;1
 Only had coffee machine in room no tea making facilities ;keamanan;1
 Only negative is that it s a shame that the apartments are across the street from the hotel You can use all the facilities but not next door ;keamanan;1
 Only one thing disappointed us housekeeping lady stormed our room at 9am even tag do not disturb which was hanging on the door didn t stop her ;keamanan;1
 Only problem they have it is exchange of information between the staff ;keamanan;1
 Overall the hotel was fine but I wasn t wow ed The W on the other hand is amazing And although the W is somewhat further away from the action as in not on the Passeia Graccia I preferred that The hotel was super crowded too crowded It did not feel like a peaceful escape from the craziness of the streets of Barcelona The room was too small and we had a view of the interior courtyard but from the first floor we were basically staring at the restaurant The W was the same price per night and I thought we got far more for our money ;keamanan;1
 Overlooking rear courtyard;keamanan;1
 Parfume smell in lobby and gym that the hotel staff probably spray around;keamanan;1
 Perfume smell everywhere in hotel;keamanan;1
 Pool could be opened earlier and later than times posted;keamanan;1
 Pool is extremely small it s more a bath than a pool There are only 6 sunbeds which are always occupied Check in slow Overall expensive for what you get there should be more outside space ;keamanan;1
 Pool was closed But staff went out of their way to sort us and allowed us two sun beds on one side Would have liked to have been informed before hand tho ;keamanan;1
 Poor Wifi Air conditioning not up to standard;keamanan;1
 Residence for our family with children had foul odor in one apartment sounds of water in another apartment My husband I stayed in main hotel enjoyed our stay without pronlem;keamanan;1
 Responses by a couple of staff when queried re late check out could be better Also room shows lack of maintenance ;keamanan;1
 Rooftop pool is quite small very few beds and no shade Room price is a bit high for what is offered specially when breakfast is not included and they charge keamanan7 per person So a couple can have breakfast for 7kenyamanan ;keamanan;1
 Room air conditioning and heating was slow to response;keamanan;1
 Room and bathroom is very small;keamanan;1
 Room could have been nicer Cupboard shelves rough and spoilt a sweater;keamanan;1
 Room is a little small but great bathroom;keamanan;1
 Room very small with narrow window;keamanan;1
 Room views not all have a good view ;keamanan;1
 Room was quite small Spa had limited availability but was good ;keamanan;1
 Rooms are somewhat small and I would definitely pay more for the city view Our view was of a service entrance and often workers were unloading garbage ;keamanan;1
 Service could have been better at the rooftop pool and would have been nice if the pool was heated ;keamanan;1
 Showers didn t work I had to ask keamanan times for someone to fix it and for another room to shower in ;keamanan;1
 Size of the room and its location without any pleasant view ;keamanan;1
 Slow check out procedure it took more than keamanankenyamanan min ;keamanan;1
 small bed if you are very tall For breakfast they don t serve fresh vegetables like tomato paprika cucumber ;keamanan;1
 Sometimes rooms next to elivator can be noisy;keamanan;1
 sound proof between rooms not good enough can hear tv sound from next door;keamanan;1
 Soundproofing Room;keamanan;1
 Stayed in the residence and didnt see a cleaner for our keamanan night stay so towels werent changed;keamanan;1
 Stayed in the residences No complimentary water no bath robes no complimentary tea coffee Constant smell of smoke despite being a non smoking hotel An ash tray with a fag in was in the lounge upon our arrival The view from the balcony was of a building site In the Residences you are treated as a definite second class visitor Will not be staying there again ;keamanan;1
 Street noise is uncomfortable ;keamanan;1
 Swimming pool is tiny Room a bit small ;keamanan;1
 Swimming pool on roof very small;keamanan;1
 terribly overpriced;keamanan;1
 The apartment was a bit sparse in decoration and beds were small ;keamanan;1
 The apartments are not part of the hotel They are located on the opposite side of the road Just disappointed we didn t get the full experience of this famous hotel Also wonder if the toilettes towels linen are the same as the the hotel Quality not what I would have expected from a 5 star In saying that we overall enjoyed our stay very much ;keamanan;1
 The appartment was over a busy road Two lifts to get to it Only one days beverages ;keamanan;1
 The bath tub was way too slow in draining water from the rain shower ;keamanan;1
 The bed is not that comfortable;keamanan;1
 the bed was a bit on the soft side for my personal taste ;keamanan;1
 The bellow is not comfertable the accesspility to the apartment is not easy you have to go from ground the upper floor then take another eleveter to reach your place;keamanan;1
 The breakfast buffet is very expensive ;keamanan;1
 The breakfast room felt a bit crowded and had little daylight Breakfast itself was great though The only very minor comment on the room is that the ceiling above the lamp shades in the bathroom was starting to color ;keamanan;1
 The check in was keamanan kenyamanankenyamanan pm which was a bit of a pain as we arrived at kebersihankerapihan kenyamanankenyamanan pm and had made arrangements for the afternoon This was made worse as we were then told that the apartment would not be ready until keamanan keamanankenyamananpm due to late check out of previous guests ;keamanan;1
 The cleaning staff are annoying they started to knock the door 9 keamanankenyamananam to ask for cleaning even if you put Do Not Disturb card they will keep coming and coming more than keamanan times This Happened everyday Food Menu need to be upgraded and to add more food especially Halal Food Pillows not that much comfort ;keamanan;1
 The description of the apartment from booking com is incorrect and i was very disappointed to have booked a 5 star hotel and end up with an apartment without windows or any of the features booking com promised ;keamanan;1
 The executive rooms had no view;keamanan;1
 The floor was consistently a bit dirty and there were ants This is probably because there was some nearby construction and so the patio was always dusty and the dust got tracked into the apartment Still it s a small compromise for the incredible space ;keamanan;1
 The furniture of the room need maintenence for example the cabinet broken and the curtain not closed;keamanan;1
 The gym is terrible ;keamanan;1
 The hotel is a bit understaffed Had to wait more than kerapihankenyamanan mins to get the car everytime kerapihankenyamanan mins at the concierge for just a dinner redervation and took keamanankenyamananmins to check in ;keamanan;1
 The information about the swimming pool on the roof did not include information that there is a terrace restaurant in the pool are so one can only swim in there during the other people having food or wine ;keamanan;1
 The initial room we booked with booking com superior double room for kerapihan adults and two kids for kenyamanankeamanan9 was on the other side of the street on the first floor on streetside about the busiiest road in Barcelona i refused that one they offered us two other rooms in the main building but then i paid double the price ;keamanan;1
 The lights could have been better;keamanan;1
 The only thing I didn t like in the room is its abit small and the windows were not tall enough we stayed in the attached building But don t let this change your mind about the hotel the stay will be worth it kebersihankenyamanankenyamanan ;keamanan;1
 The pillows are too soft they become almost flat Hot water difficult to control in the shower From the internet description we had the impression that the hotel was in the centre of town however it was further than expected from most shopping opportunities except luxury items ;keamanan;1
 The pool area is to small Drinks weren t good ;keamanan;1
 The pool is small and not many deckchairs ;keamanan;1
 The rain shower didn t work well Hot water quickly turned cold Problem with water pressure I imagine Didnt enjoy that shower turning hot and cold ;keamanan;1
 The reception place was not so luxury so i would like a more luxury and comfort reception desk;keamanan;1
 The restaurant at the terrace food options and the staff service was very slow ;keamanan;1
 The rooftop bar was impossible to get into without having booked a space There isn t much room and people off the street are there as well as guests ;keamanan;1
 The room was small comparing to other five stars hotels of same rate also one lift was always giving problem during my stay last couple of days the hotel entrance canopy was under maintenance which caused some nuisance while entering leaving ;keamanan;1
 The terrace on the top floor was chaos Access was only possible if you queued and as a hotel guest you were not giving any priority but stood behind people who were not even staying in the hotel The car took keamanankenyamanan minutes to get delivered back to me even though I requested it kebersihankenyamanan minutes before coming down to check out The spa on the top floor has to be reserved and once again in a hotel so large it is not easy to find the time you want In general this is a kenyamanan star hotel there are far better choices for real 5 star luxury in Barcelona at the same price ;keamanan;1
 The toilets in both the bathrooms were constantly filling up in the cistern which kept me awake throughout the night as I am a light sleeper didn t seem to bother my husband though ;keamanan;1
 The transparent minibar door The light from the minibar shone directly on us and as a result the room was too brightly lit at night ;keamanan;1
 The wi fi went out all over the hotel for two days of our stay which made it difficult for us to connect with our transportation company and airlines Our cruise ship arrived in port early causing us to arrive at the hotel by 9 kenyamanankenyamanan am We were told check in time was keamanan kenyamanankenyamanan pm and our room would not be available until then At keamanan kenyamanankenyamanan pm the maid was still cleaning Luggage and personal items of the previous guest was in the room when the bellman escorted us there for our stay ;keamanan;1
 There needed to be more mirrors and plugs in the apartments not just in the bathrooms The layout of the second bedroom wardrobes could do with improving as not good when sharing with friends and everyone needed to get ready ;keamanan;1
 There want anything remotely negative about our experience;keamanan;1
 There was some noise at night a motor pumping every 5 minutes There no iron table in the rooms if u need one remember to place an order before u get there ;keamanan;1
 They charged us for water and coffee in the room when they said there was coffee and tea making facilities;keamanan;1
 They don t clean the apartment if you stay for less than kebersihan week;keamanan;1
 They forgot to pick me from the airport;keamanan;1
 They take a long time at the reception desk ;keamanan;1
 To me it is generally not acceptable for such category hotel with relative expensive room rate even not inclusive of breakfast And the breakfast charge alone is also very expensive But I still tried but ended up with disappointments Staff were nice but not quite responsive I called for service but no one was picking up the phone at all I went downstairs and spoke to the reception desk but they just blamed it to the telephone line I like to stay in luxury hotel when I am traveling pleasure To have different experience so that I can share with my friends I chose two hotels just nearby keamanan nights at Hotel Palace GL which was fantastic and kerapihan nights at Majestic But to be honest the latter was very much below my expectations ;keamanan;1
 Too old equipment dirty sofa narrow old bed with noise shabby towls terrible luggage service ;keamanan;1
 Top floor restaurant was very pricy but great view and service kebersihan8 euros cocktails Did not eat breakfast at hotel as it was keamanan9 95 euros per person ;keamanan;1
 Two days missed the coffee in the room ;keamanan;1
 Two elevators only ;keamanan;1
 Very thing is extremely good;keamanan;1
 Watch almost certainly stolen by housekeeping lady who was the only one entering room during that period ;keamanan;1
 We attempted to take advantage of the hotel pool but both times it was closed for private events That was disapointing because the pool was part of the reason we booked the hotel and we headed back from site seeing for a pool break only to find out it was closed ;keamanan;1
 We did not want to leave ;keamanan;1
 We didn t feel part of the hotel and its facilities There was no tea and coffee and although I checked before and was told there would be we had to ask keamanan times before some came Even then we were told it was chargeable at kebersihan5 for kebersihankenyamanan coffee Nespresso pods Which when we said we were told it was included they didn t charge ;keamanan;1
 We felt that the bedroom was much smaller than we had expected and poor value for money the breakfasts were also very expensive;keamanan;1
 We had an apartment across the road thought it not in keeping with the rest of the hotel It was a little tired Would also have liked a larger pool Disappointed that we had to pay for the use of the sauna;keamanan;1
 We have no complaints whatsoever ;keamanan;1
 We loved the apartment although I did feel that sometimes it wasn t cleaned as good as it could have been and some things were not replenished such as the toilet roll and the nespresso coffee ;keamanan;1
 We ourder from the hotel to clean up our room they sayed will change us That was surprising me ;keamanan;1
 We went to the restaurant for breakfast kebersihan5 before it closed and were turned away There was no flexibility with a very rigid in the closing time so we had to go to the lobby bar and order something to eat ;keamanan;1
 Weak WiFi signal Beds are movable ;keamanan;1
 When I Checked in at keamanan kenyamanankenyamananpm my suite wasn t ready and the staff told me to wait for one hour I had to speak to the supervisor to get the room in 5 minutes ;keamanan;1
 Wi Fi connection in the Apartments was unreliable But the staff tried their best to help us out ;keamanan;1
 Wi Fi hit and miss ;keamanan;1
 Wi Fi kept going out;keamanan;1
 Wifi was not functioning in the hotel for most of the stay This was being repaired ;keamanan;1
 would not rate it a 5 star bathrrom tatty and apartments were further from hotel than we expected could not believe we had to book to use sauna steam room and PAY that was bang out of order have stayed in many kenyamanan star and much better and full use of all facilities at no extra cost would not recomend;keamanan;1
 Zip ;keamanan;1
 kebersihan Air conditioning badly worked it was too cold in room kerapihan Breakfast is too expensive;keamanan;1
 kebersihan Bellyboy was rude with the taxi guy kerapihan Location keamanan Slow wifi;keamanan;1
 kebersihan I had the worst experience with one of the taxi driver from the hotel who supposed to take me to the musikverein but he drove me to the museumquartier and i end up paying extra for his mistakes And i seriously doubt his mistakes was unintentional as i show him the brochure and ticket to Mozart Orchestra in Musikverein Only an idiot will think an orchestra will be play in museumquartier This is totally unacceptable and i almost late for my orchestra because of his mistake kerapihan The walkway outside the room at 7th floor was pitch dark after midnight And this make me feel slightly unsafe during the night and cause me slight difficulty to walk to the elevator during my early morning check out at 5 am keamanan The only non German language TV channel was CNN For the price we paid i think you can afford to order a few more other English channel ;keamanan;1
 kerapihankeamanan euro breakfast There is a cafe about a keamanan minute walk away that does similar breakfasts for about 5 to 7 euros But you pays your money you takes your choice An English idiom ;keamanan;1
 kerapihankeamanan euros for breakfast definitely not worth it ;keamanan;1
 5 minutes before kebersihankenyamanan keamanankenyamanan staff starts to look at watch to close door to breakfast buffet exactly at kebersihankenyamanan kerapihan9 59 feels like staff has to catch a train Furthermore breakfast cleaning of tables etc is excellent;keamanan;1
 6keamanan euro for a keamananrd bed in the suite Not mentioned at booking time This is not a kenyamanan star hotel international standards something was always missing in the room I never called the reception that often Room service up to kebersihankenyamananpm only No Kettle in the room and we had a suite Don t count on the staff ;keamanan;1
 A bit of a walk from the old city centre ;keamanan;1
 A coffee tea maker in the room ;keamanan;1
 A guy knocked on my door so heavily that I thought someone was going to break the door When I opened the door worried turned out he was offering a chocolate asking for a tip Otherwise everything else with the hotel was pretty decent ;keamanan;1
 A little away from centre but no problem if you get a travel pass very cheap ;keamanan;1
 A little too business orientated ;keamanan;1
 a previous guest drank a bit of the coca cola and topped the bottle with water and put the cap back on Other than that i was very happy;keamanan;1
 A small suggestion Breakfast at Executive Lounge should be just a little better taking care of Have a person there all the time and match at least the breakfast offer from the first floor ;keamanan;1
 A swimming pool would be a plus ;keamanan;1
 About kerapihankenyamanan mins walking from the opera House keeping didn t fill the soap dispenser ;keamanan;1
 About keamanankenyamanan minutes walk to city area which can be tiring after a day out ;keamanan;1
 Although front desk help were friendly they were not always knowledgable or helpful for the tourist For example we asked about bus transportation and were told we could buy a ticket on the bus This is not true but the bus driver was very kind and gave us the ride to the metro anyway We were also not told that a good option would be to purchase a kerapihankenyamanan hour ticket for a full day of travel which they knew were our plans This would have been helpful Also the modern decor was a little bland and lacked character ;keamanan;1
 Although this is a not exactly a bad thing more on like a bit of cribbing on my part and would not change my opinion about the hotel or my experience but the AC in our room didn t actually work all that great The summer this year in Vienna was quite high for Europe so we felt it and it wasn t fun when we came back to our hotel room to find that the temp we had set never actually even reached what we had set it to for the entire stay Also again though really not important it would be nice to get some other TV channels in English other than just your regular news channels ;keamanan;1
 Always the price ;keamanan;1
 An Executive lounge that didn t provide alcoholic drinks at any time of the day ;keamanan;1
 As a side note for the fitness inclined the gym equipment was in a nice space but was minimal outdated and in some cases poorly maintained ;keamanan;1
 At times the heat in the room was a little overpowering but you are able to control it it might be that we just didn t get the correct setting ;keamanan;1
 attention to detail I asked for the receipt with specific details on it and never got it;keamanan;1
 Aware that breakfast was not included in the room but there was a kettle and coffee cups but no tea coffee;keamanan;1
 Bar and lobby was a bit clinical;keamanan;1
 Bar staff were rude The room had stains all over the carpet It was very noisy from the road could do with better insulated windows The bathroom door frame had a massive piece broken off Would expect way better from a kenyamanan star standard in Vienna;keamanan;1
 bathroom no caffe or tea in room;keamanan;1
 Bells at five to seven each morning ;keamanan;1
 Big problems with WIFI connection Somewhere worked properly somewhere with huge problems ;keamanan;1
 Booked a taxi for kenyamanan am taxi never turned very disappointed excellent hotel;keamanan;1
 Breakfast a little too expensive we didn t take it ;keamanan;1
 Breakfast and car parking a tad pricey ;keamanan;1
 Breakfast and dining room very expensive and no coffee making facilities in the bedroom ;keamanan;1
 Breakfast at kerapihankeamanan euros is very expensive I didn t enquire if a smaller cheaper breakfast is available;keamanan;1
 Breakfast buffet for kerapihankeamanan is very expensive so we didn t take it but there are places around which offer good breakfast for less than the price The Sauna was broken the kerapihannd night and the floor was flooded the first night The hotel is quite big ;keamanan;1
 Breakfast had a high rate to be included with the stay Doesn t deal with an agency offering tours with good values ;keamanan;1
 Breakfast in executive lounge cooked food was lukewarm Disappointing ;keamanan;1
 Breakfast is not included in price This is not desirable for a four star hotel ;keamanan;1
 Breakfast is overpriced No replenishment of bathroom amenities ;keamanan;1
 Breakfast is rather expensive if you don t have it included ;keamanan;1
 Breakfast is really overpriced A less choice and untasty Never again;keamanan;1
 Breakfast is way too expensive so I decided to have breakfast elsewhere;keamanan;1
 Breakfast seemed very expensive so we opted not to take it in hotel;keamanan;1
 Breakfast was expensive so we chose to breakfast elsewhere there are plenty cafes and bakeries nearby ;keamanan;1
 Breakfast was not included in our booking ;keamanan;1
 breakfast was only ok Fruit wasn t very fresh ;keamanan;1
 Breakfast was very expensive so we opted out ;keamanan;1
 Breakfast was very expensive so we opted to get breakfast each morning at places near the tram stop at the entrance to the train station ;keamanan;1
 Breakfast was very expensive we only wanted a cup of coffee and a croissant;keamanan;1
 Breakfast wasn t included in the price when I made the booking;keamanan;1
 Brekfast quality is so poor Tasteless scrambled eggs sausage cheeses and vegetables The bacon was over roasted Was surprised Expected more ;keamanan;1
 but a great hotel will realise you need a reservation and arrange for this something this hotel did not do ;keamanan;1
 Carpet seem a little worn out;keamanan;1
 Check in time hours Room service no answer when called on kerapihankebersihan keamanankenyamanan ;keamanan;1
 Checking out and having to leave this beautiful hotel ;keamanan;1
 City centre not being instantly accessible from hotel;keamanan;1
 Cleaning of room is done to late ;keamanan;1
 Cleaning the room needs to be done in a better way ;keamanan;1
 Coffee and tea with kettle not available in the room and weak internet service;keamanan;1
 Could be VERY busy at breakfast waiting for a table is a possibility at peak times;keamanan;1
 Could have a better concierge service;keamanan;1
 Decor felt a bit out of date ;keamanan;1
 Decor looks a little basic ;keamanan;1
 Definitely should improve the spa center The steamy sa na had unpleasant smell Maybe add a mint flavor ;keamanan;1
 Difficult to criticise anything ;keamanan;1
 Dirty carpet in room Poor support service ;keamanan;1
 Dirty carpet which was being cleaned Due pets Internet didn t work Couldn t make phone calls from mobile from room kerapihan weeks in Europe and this was only place it didn t work;keamanan;1
 Dirty floor and there was a gap between bathroom floor and bedroom carpet that if walking on it one would trip Dinner was ok Lobby misses on design Overpriced for the quality;keamanan;1
 Disappointed by the lack of tea coffee facilities in the room and the health suite contained only one resistance machine The maid also kept forgetting to leave clean cups towels or toiletries Nothing that would spoil a holiday but could all easily be fixed ;keamanan;1
 During check in they blocked 5kenyamanan on my card without telling me in advance Breakfast is quite overpriced ;keamanan;1
 Duvet needed cleaning Drain in tub did not drain Dust everywhere Could not get server attention for coffee at breakfast Level of attitude down regarding customers ;keamanan;1
 Electronic key failed twice;keamanan;1
 Even though our non smoking room was spotlessly clean and we felt no smoke odor in the room there was a strong cigarette smell within the wardrobe Our clothes got impregnated with that smell Breakfast was good but way too expensive ;keamanan;1
 Every thing is baaaaaaad ;keamanan;1
 Every thing was apt ;keamanan;1
 Everything was good about Vienna;keamanan;1
 Exec room balconies need better furniture and loungers;keamanan;1
 Executive lounge is open til kebersihan7 keamanankenyamanan Could be open longer in order to be available for business travelers ;keamanan;1
 Expensive breakfast slow wifi ;keamanan;1
 Extra fee for parking;keamanan;1

 Furniture was little bit old and weary ;keamanan;1
 Good tv channels but everything was dubbed in German so we couldnt watch a movie once the kids fell asleep I also thought the room service charge of 5 every time was a bit pricey since we ordered every night The room service menu and bar food menu were a bit limited with food but besides that everything was great We loved the hotel and the location ;keamanan;1
 Guarantee amount on credit card is still not released keamanan days after departure;keamanan;1
 Had food removed from our fridge and on complaint only some was returned ;keamanan;1
 Had some parking difficulties Finally i used the Park and Ride further down the street ;keamanan;1
 Had to complain about cleaniness of room room was not cleaned properly during our kenyamanan day stay Complained at reception desk and as yet have not received feedback from hotel Breakfast was very expensive ;keamanan;1
 Have no smoking room When outside wind kenyamanankeamananm h this is really unbelievable ;keamanan;1
 Heat in room was too warm and unable to control thermostat ;keamanan;1
 high price of breakfast;keamanan;1
 House keeper took coffee cups twice all glasses from room forgot to replace Request made at reception it rectify within kebersihankenyamanan mins;keamanan;1
 I can t fault anything Only a swimming pool could have made it better to ease the aching feet of sightseeing ;keamanan;1
 I can t think of anything that I did not like about the hotel ;keamanan;1
 I did not like that we had to buy our coffee and tea for the room A couple of tea and coffee sachets put daily would not have cost a lot yet would have added a lot of value to one s stay ;keamanan;1
 I didn t lie the parking prices kebersihan8 per night and I hotel like this one should provide free parking for its customers also I didn t like the breakfasts only few choices and it s was average to be honest also I didn t like the bedding in the rooms if you chose a king size you will have two beds aunt two mattresses and two blankets joiend together as king size bed together otherwise the hotel is wonderful;keamanan;1
 I didn t really like the breakfast there were no feta cheese or Philadelphia In the first day the guy who cooks the omelette was absent We had asked for double bed we were offered with two individual beds which were attached together ;keamanan;1
 I didnt like the deposit of charging 5kenyamanan EUR booking com did not tell about this There should be hot water boiler in a hotel like this it is not a luxury Air conditioner is working too noisily ;keamanan;1
 I gave the front desk the printed reservation She said This doesn t help I said it usually does She said is this your first time staying in our hotel I asked is the breakfast included in the rate She said unfortunately no as you booked with such cheap price ;keamanan;1
 I just wanted to mention that as I had booked online as non refundable for executive suite and deluxe room there was no flexibility of changing to a family suite to accommodate keamanan adults me and my kerapihan older children when I asked at the hotel ;keamanan;1
 I liked it all You ll be glad to know I didn t eat it all ;keamanan;1
 I m not use to the split bed and would have liked a queen or king It is probably better to say I m not use to the split ;keamanan;1
 I m smoker and it s Not for the smokers;keamanan;1
 I made it very clear that its my first visit to Vienna and must have a room with a pleasant view I was given first a room looking at the basement of the hotel and the interior of the buildings MUST PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT A GUEST IS ASKING FOR DURING THE ONLINE RESERVATION ;keamanan;1
 I think they are not very friendly to every people like Chinese people ;keamanan;1
 I ve booked a luxury room and there was kerapihan single beds in my email through booking I ve asked to have kebersihan king size bed and they kindly replied that we could have kebersihan sheet and kebersihan duvet on the top but after all they didn t help with my requests I think they should follow up with the customers At the reception they need to smile more overall was a good experience ;keamanan;1
 I would appreciate a welcome bottle of water;keamanan;1
 I would say putting a kettle in the room with tea and coffee would complete it And using a double bed rather than two singles just to make it perfect ;keamanan;1
 I wouldn t recommend having breakfast here because it s too expensive unless you eat lots of food early in the morning There are nice cafes close to the hotel where you can have a good breakfast at a more convenient price ;keamanan;1
 if it were directly in the city centre it would be the perfect hotel ;keamanan;1
 If you have a standard room without a view be prepared for a view of a wall with other room s windows The parking was extremely expensive Reception from front desk not very friendly or helpful ;keamanan;1
 Internet is slow ;keamanan;1
 Internet was a little spotty good for most people but not for those looking to do work on a laptop ;keamanan;1
 It is close to S Bahn but not U Bahn which may be confusing sometimes ;keamanan;1
 It s a bit overpriced now because of the Christmas Holidays So we r waiting for its price to become usual and of course very expensive breakfasts for permanent clients it might be cheaper;keamanan;1
 It was a little awkward to get into the hotel sometimes we had to wait a few moments for the front doors to open automatically It would also be good if tea and coffee were provided for free in the rooms instead of for purchase at reception ;keamanan;1
 It was a little far from the centre of Vienna if you don t mind walking it won t be a problem ;keamanan;1
 It was a little outside of the ring roads of Vienna but still within a short taxi ride ;keamanan;1
 It was my first time in Austria and it was a surprise to discover that no tea coffee is automatically provided even though there was a kettle in the room A printed notice next to the kettle would be welcome ;keamanan;1
 It was not close to the underground but right on a tram stop ;keamanan;1
 Just few recommendations I stayed in an executive room with a coffee machine for which special capsules were needed that could not be found in the supermarket Our coffee capsules finished kenyamanan of them and no new ones were ever left we stayed for five days I have already made a recommendation in my previous reviews to replace the machine with a simple electric cattle which can be used for making tea and coffee without special capsules Often the used cups or taken away and no clean ones were left which made us use plastic cups from the fitness The same cups are to be used for both tea and coffee They are ok for coffee but way too small for tea It would be good to have at breakfast and in the rooms two types of cups mugs for tea and smaller cups for coffee It would be nice to have more and newer machines in the fitness ;keamanan;1
 Kettle provided in room but no coffee or tea which seems a bit pointless Did not try expensive kerapihankeamanan breakfast ;keamanan;1
 Lack of tea kettle ;keamanan;1
 less choices for veggie breakfast;keamanan;1
 Little amount of soap and shampoo;keamanan;1
 Little bit expensive parking is public and payed kebersihan8 per day;keamanan;1
 Little bit far from city;keamanan;1
 Location kebersihan5 min walk from the nearest underground Pricey Breakfast;keamanan;1
 Location Closer to city centre would have been better as a tourist hotel ;keamanan;1
 Location is about kebersihankenyamanan minutes taxi ride to the centre but is beside Bellvedere Museum;keamanan;1
 Location is not in the center and is a kebersihankenyamanan mins trip by tram with the same rate you can get another hotel in the center with a lot more convenient location;keamanan;1
 Location is not that close to the city center;keamanan;1
 Location not ideal for city centre but acceptable Very limited food availability in the evenings unless one used the formal restaurant;keamanan;1
 Location slightly out of town and a bit disappointed room without a view ;keamanan;1
 long waiting time for checkin;keamanan;1
 Minibar is bad because not cool Front staff is not kind ;keamanan;1
 Missing the morning coffee at reception when you check out early kenyamanan 7 am ;keamanan;1
 More choice blankets and pillows ;keamanan;1
 More choice on the room service menu for main meals I thought I have ordered a hot beef dish and it was a beef sandwich ;keamanan;1
 More opportunities for an evening meal rather than the main restaurant We had bar snacks a couple of times but would have liked a simple meal as there aren t many other restaurants in the area ;keamanan;1
 my mother was in bed getting ready to sleep and suddenly found an insect worm like on her bed side crawling very fast and it was just disgusting and turned her off completely from the hotel our room window didn t have a view which was a bit on the negative side don t know why the hotel architect chose to design hotel rooms overlooking a courtyard with nothing but other hotel room s windows Other than that the hotel s room and facilities were v good ;keamanan;1
 My room was not cleaned on one occasion and when I returned late in the evening I was very displeased The duty manager arranged for clean towels but unfortunately they were all face cloths so it took me a while to mop myself dry the next morning ;keamanan;1
 Neighborhood lacked acceptable restaurants noisy main street location breakfast outrageously expensive at kerapihankeamanan euros person tour bus crowds going into and out of the hotel at all hours ;keamanan;1

 No tea or coffee making facility in the room ;keamanan;1
 No Ubahn very close by but a tram service and a train station are literally kerapihan minutes walk away Closest Ubahn is either keamanan tram stops and a 5 min walk away or a walk through the Belvedere Park which the hotel is right beside to get to another stop ;keamanan;1

 Not very personally decorated feels a bit like Heathrow Nothing especially nice in the area close to the hotel ;keamanan;1
 Not very service minded we asked for a tea in the evening after we arrived to the hotel tired by whole day sightseeing and they told us the bar and kitchen was closed and we could not get any hot beverages neither tea neither coffee The furniture in the room was very old with scratches and looked not very nice Also the bed has two separate mattress not very comfortable for a couple ;keamanan;1

 Nothing We had a wonderful experience ;keamanan;1
 One coffee machine in breakfast area and kebersihankenyamanankenyamanan people competing to use it ;keamanan;1
 One day they did not clean the room but it was a minor thing The only really bad thing in the hotel is the low quality Wi Fi connection And it is really bad breaks down each 5 kebersihankenyamanan seconds So no videos or Skype during the stay ;keamanan;1
 One staff member at reception recommended a restaurant worth trying serving traditional Viennese sweets When we arrived there it was closed and we were very disappointed Maybe ideally she should have double checked if the place was open Adding this value to customers is important ;keamanan;1
 One travelling companion needed to take medication first thing in the morning and would have loved a tea making facility or similar In addition the shower gel installed in the wall was so hard to squeeze it kept falling off the wall ;keamanan;1
 Only the non provision of porridge at breakfast;keamanan;1
 Our only negative comment is that the WiFi was not very good inside the room ;keamanan;1
 Our stay was over a weekend and on the Saturday morning housekeeping knocked at 8 kenyamanankenyamanan then again at kenyamanan9 kenyamanankenyamanan asking when we will be leaving the room so she could clean it This is not what I would expect especially at the weekend when guest are there for leisure ;keamanan;1
 parking kerapihan5 euro per day;keamanan;1
 People waiting to get a table for breakfast;keamanan;1
 Perhaps they could offer a shuttle service to airport more people to defray cost ;keamanan;1
 personal very slow bad attitude and bad english;keamanan;1
 Poor view out of the window inner empty court The receptionist upon arrival was not particularly friendly ;keamanan;1
 Poor wifi connection in the room ;keamanan;1
 Possibly the overhead projector system could project onto a larger screen My colleagues near the back of the room found some of the wording on the projection too small Perhaps use a second projector and screen half way down the confernce room ;keamanan;1
 Pretty much everything was fine Didn t have much of a view but we were there only one night You out did yourselves The place we stayed in Salzburg the next night was awful compared to your place of business ;keamanan;1
 price and conditions of the parking for hotel guests carpet on the floor moquette ;keamanan;1
 Price of breakfast and parking garage is a little bit expensive;keamanan;1
 Provide toothpaste in bathroom perhaps ;keamanan;1
 really expensive breakfast but I must admit it was quite tasty with a huge variety of options and a great coffee and juice bad gym facilities no dumbbells and some rather shaky treadmill bikes ;keamanan;1
 Reception staff unhelpful inexperienced girls with no clue Room could be cleaner some hair and dust it was probably a hit hotel years back in time now it feels the past Ah the doors are modernised but do not open and close really well ;keamanan;1
 Reception staff were good but could have been better Given more information;keamanan;1
 relatively small screen;keamanan;1
 Restaurant Dover sole was very disappointing;keamanan;1
 Room AC doesn t have heating option and in winter it s essential Rest other facilities are awesome ;keamanan;1
 room service hours were not respected we couldn t even order what was in the bar s menu one of the bartenders didn t understand English at all for example while having a beer downstairs at the bar we asked for some peanuts and he kept telling us that the cook already left ;keamanan;1
 room was cleaned each day but could have been done a bit more thoroughly;keamanan;1
 Rooms were cold ;keamanan;1
 Seems should walk for a while for Wiener Stephansdom;keamanan;1
 Services is stale front desk personnel won t go out of their way to help you out Using UBER in this hotel might be tricky as the concierge seems to push you to use Taxis;keamanan;1
 Shame breakfast is not included We decided kerapihankeamanan Euro too expensive so had breakfast at a bakery round the corner ;keamanan;1
 Shower flooded bathroom each morning;keamanan;1
 Slightly far from the most attractions and tourists routes kerapihan5 keamanankenyamanan minutes by walk Slightly expensive breakfast ;keamanan;1
 Slightly further away from the centre than we might have wished but not a deal breaker by any means It s just that the local area was pretty devoid of bars and restaurants which was a pity Otherwise no negative issues whatsoever ;keamanan;1
 Slow WiFi no complimentary in room coffee or tea poorly equipped fitness room In my opinion ;keamanan;1
 Slow WiFi Poorly equipped fitness centre ;keamanan;1
 Soap dispensers were not practical lack of coffee Tea in rooms unsecure Internet access no password protection ;keamanan;1
 Some rooms have kerapihan twins as double bed Might be bothersome for some people;keamanan;1
 Somehow front desk employees during night shift grave yard shift are not of the same quality as day staff Everywhere you stay Same here Uninterested just doing their thing ;keamanan;1
 sometimes at peak times the check in and check out is very busy with tour groups and as an individual waiting times can be kebersihankenyamanan minutes either more staff required or express check out for frequent guests ;keamanan;1
 Sorry but i can t think of something that i didn t like there;keamanan;1
 speed of internet weak;keamanan;1
 Staff aloof Breakfast not as good quality as I had expected Quite a walk from the centre;keamanan;1
 Staff not the most friendly;keamanan;1
 That the booking com listing stated shuttle service to the airport which is incorrect Breakfast buffet is overpriced kerapihankeamanan euros so we chose to eat elsewhere ;keamanan;1
 That they make me wait until kenyamanan pm to get my room;keamanan;1
 That we had to get breakfast elsewhere I say we had to because you had to pay kerapihankeamanan euros per night per person if you wanted the breakfast buffet A little too expensive for our taste ;keamanan;1
 The 7th floor restaurant was not particularly good value for money with a very limited menu We had a piano player one night but he made many mistakes and played far too loudly ;keamanan;1
 The absence of kettle bathrobe slippers Not friendly person on reception during our check in Very expensive breakfast and parking;keamanan;1

 The beds were small even for an average height person;keamanan;1
 The breakfast fruit had a funny strange artificial taste so I could not eat it Breakfast could be improved since it is expensive and not included in the price The rooms are large and nice but stained carpets make them look older ;keamanan;1
 THE BREAKFAST IS TOO EXPENSIVE THE ROOMS DON T HAVE FACILITIES LIKE A COFFEE TEA MACHINE AND THE FRIGOBAR IS NOT VERY GOOD THE HOTEL IS A LITTLE BIT FAR FROM THE CITY ;keamanan;1
 The breakfast offered as an extra to our accommodation was satisfactory but we did not think it very good value ;keamanan;1
 The breakfast section was not great and I was not very impressed with the executive lounge compared to others I had previously visited in other hotels ;keamanan;1
 The breakfast served on the seventh floor was poor and not a great deal of choice for the extra paid by guests ;keamanan;1
 The breakfast was ordinary;keamanan;1
 The breakfast while good is on the pricey end You can skip the buffet and get tasty Viennese breakfast cakes and coffee everywhere else for more value ;keamanan;1
 The breakfasts at kerapihankeamanan was a bit steep Not enough fruit tho my husband was happy;keamanan;1
 The cleaning stuff was so insistent to get in the room very early in the morning 7 kenyamanankenyamanan 8 kenyamanankenyamanan AM it seemed not so nice to us because the check out was later of course ;keamanan;1
 The decor and furniture are somewhat stark Could benefit from better seating areas in the reception Had the atmosphere of a short stay business hotel Limited gym spa facilities ;keamanan;1
 The doors to the rooms looked like lockers cupboards which didn t give it a cosy feel at all The long corridors made the ambience even more business like But for the price we paid this is not much to complain about ;keamanan;1
 The duvet cover is too small ;keamanan;1
 The fee of the breakfeast was terrible high ;keamanan;1
 The fitness room could be equipped a bit better ;keamanan;1

 The guy on the reception did not speak English The view of the superior room was to the internal courtyard;keamanan;1
 The gym equipment is very basic;keamanan;1

 The hotel is far from the center and the wifi is very slow ;keamanan;1
 The in house breakfast is pricey but there are other cafes near the restaurant to choose from ;keamanan;1
 The interior of hotel is too modern compared to wonderful historic exterior ;keamanan;1
 The lack of a small provision of English breakfast Tea and coffee to accompany the kettle which was provided in the room ;keamanan;1
 The lobby could be more lighted and cosy;keamanan;1
 the location is ineresting close to the belvedere which is beautiful but a bit far from the city center though it is well connected through the train station nearby ;keamanan;1
 The matress was run down and just too soft and the duvee was hot but that s not hotels fault I m just hot anytime of the year The ac was loud but amendable by turning the fan on low Breakfast is a tad expensive at kerapihankenyamanan per person ;keamanan;1
 The only bad thing is there aren t any English Channels on TV except bbc But no English movie channels;keamanan;1
 The pillow s a low quality even if the bedsheet was OK The heating was not operational in our room ;keamanan;1
 The pineapple at breakfast had a really bizar taste ;keamanan;1
 the poor English of the staff from the breakfast the burned bacon from the breakfast that seemed ok for the staff ;keamanan;1
 the reception bar closing to fast but this is not a minus just an observation for party guys like us ;keamanan;1
 The reception man in the Check in was rude and impolite;keamanan;1
 The reception staff weren t particularly friendly or helpful No help was offered to take our cases to our room when we first arrived Also if you have a fear of lifts this isn t the hotel for you This is the first hotel I ve ever stayed in where there wasn t the option of using stairs to get to your room The emergency staircase led outside and not to the rooms My Mum and I were forced to use the lift which created an anxiety which we d have preferred not to have on holiday We wouldn t return there for this reason Lovely quiet room though and very comfy beds No dressing gowns or slippers and no tea coffee making facilities in the room ;keamanan;1
 The receptionists looked indifferent but were helpful in fact The daily leaning left much to be desired ;keamanan;1
 The reservation process through Bookings com This was the first time I have had trouble with a reservation There were mixed up charges and rooms that took a few weeks to straighten out but the hotel worked with us and corrected everything before we arrived The lounge dinner menu is not kid friendly We had hoped to eat in the hotel restaurant after a day of touring but the fine dining menu left us looking for something else If you re traveling over Easter a lot of places are closed ;keamanan;1
 The restaurant and bar staff need to try harder for being professional While paying a waitress asked my name and room number and then said this is not your room I had to explain her that she has not seen my first name on the system and her behavior is rude She appologized then Another waiter asked me do you know what to want to eat before handing the menu in These were minor problems though generally the hotel is of high standard in my oponion ;keamanan;1
 The restaurant was quite expensive and the menu was limited but other restaurants were nearby ;keamanan;1
 The room had no tea coffee facilities The door did not close spontaneously and was difficult to close The breakfast area was small and was crowded and with little choice;keamanan;1

 the room was not located for good viewing;keamanan;1
 the room was not ready as ordered;keamanan;1
 The room was very warm and the air conditioning took a while to work its magic ;keamanan;1
 The soap dispensers were awkward and a nuisance They don t do little bars of soap ;keamanan;1
 The SPA area all clean well furnished with free bathrobe and sleepers but the relaxing area has slippery floor neon lights that make the area not relaxing ;keamanan;1
 The staff of the hotel is a bit wooden it s as if politeness is forced on them like they don t really enjoy their jobs We didn t have any negative experience really but you d just expect a bit more polite cheerful attitude from a hotel of this caliber Also the fact that there s no real double bed in the rooms is a bummer ;keamanan;1
 The staff responsible for replenishing the mini bar in the executive room section was completely useless No effect of complaints made Their services should be terminated ;keamanan;1
 The staff was a bit distant Nothing wrong with them but not really friendly maybe they just had a stressed day If you go there for the weekend by car don t pay the garage at the reception you can pay it in the garage and it s much cheaper ;keamanan;1
 The staff was distant and not necessarily friendly The cleanliness of the rooms and bathrooms was not great More effort should be made to keep this nice property clean tidy and welcoming ;keamanan;1
 The staff was quite rude and I am not use to that kind of treatment They were not helpful and did not help in any way and being a solo traveler this really impacted my stay in Vienna Do not come here if you do not speak German and if you are alone you will receive poor treatment Vienna is a beautiful city but my stay at this hotel almost ruined my trip ;keamanan;1
 The staff were absolutely appalling I arrived at 7 am and asked to check in was told that checking in is at keamanan pm and I would have to wait until they call me if an available room arises I waited for keamanan and a half hours at the hotel exhausted without any sleep from the long flight and no phone call was made I got up and went to the reception almost drooling in exhaustion and I gently spoke excuse me I ve been waiting for keamanan and a half hours and no one called me can you check if there is an available room by now The absolutely appalling reply came Well I cannot kick guests out of the hotel for you Shocked I replied obviously I realize that I m not an idiot and there s no reason for you to speak in this way I need you to check if there s an available room that s it She suddenly checks the computer and says well there s a room available on floor two is floor two suitable The insanity of this conversation is enough for me to never come back to this hotel ;keamanan;1
 The weather in Vienna was extremely hot when we were there and there was no A C in the lobby areas and the room wasn t that cool The minibar refrigerator never really got cold either ;keamanan;1
 The wellness area could be better steam sauna was not looking really that attractive Wifi coverage was good but could be a bit faster ;keamanan;1
 The wifi did not always connect ;keamanan;1
 The wifi is horrible unable to connect AT ALL ;keamanan;1
 The wifi signal was very poor The shower was broken and leaking ;keamanan;1
 The worst was the internet connection which didn t work so we had to be given a wire to connect directly I also found it disappointing that there was no equipment in the room to make tea coffea Other details included the fact that after kerapihanh the water dispenser had still not been topped up in the fitness room after asking twice and the fact that the sauna left yellow marks on the towels and smelt bad when water was added ;keamanan;1
 There could have been coffee making facilities in the room but that is nothing much ;keamanan;1
 there is no options of early check in kenyamanan 5 station far from the center I did change the room kay kenyamanan times in keamanan days the price is the same like kenyamanan star hotel at the center ther is no value to the money;keamanan;1
 There was a little bit of damage to the bathroom door and it would have been nice to have facilities to make tea and coffee in the room as well as just the minibar options;keamanan;1
 There was a problem with the air conditioning in the gym but it was solved eventually ;keamanan;1
 There was no food available after kebersihankenyamananpm ;keamanan;1
 There was nothing we didn t like but it would have been nice if they could vary the restaurant menu through the week ;keamanan;1
 There wasn t anything about this hotel that we didn t like it was fab ;keamanan;1
 There ws nothing to dislike;keamanan;1
 They asked for a 5kenyamanan eur guarantee for the mini bar and to deposit an amount for the price of the whole trip on my credit card First time that this happened and I was really disappointed by the fact that we were not alerted by this at time of booking ;keamanan;1
 They asked for the passport of everyone We where kebersihan8 person with little kids I think it would be more comfortable to ask only for the father or mother They took extra amount for ensurance kerapihankenyamanankenyamanan ;keamanan;1
 They charge extra money just for bringing room service That was not much pleasant I guess ;keamanan;1
 They could have told us that the restaurants were closed two nights every week ;keamanan;1
 They didn t change our bed linen even though we asked for it ;keamanan;1
 They told me it is not allowed to park in street just good for short parking Later I found out this rule is for Mo Fr but I stayed weekend The parking garage is hotel property and cost extra kebersihan7EUR ;keamanan;1
 Tipical big conference Hotel;keamanan;1
 Too distant from central Vienna for sightseeing and not really close to a subway station either ;keamanan;1
 Traffic could be noisy in room facing the main road ;keamanan;1
 Transportation from the hotel to city center is limited ;keamanan;1
 Two single beds joined together is the only option and was very uncomfortable for us as the beds kept seperating easily Breakfast is too expensive Wifi is slow ;keamanan;1
 Uncomfortable bed Shower door would not stay shut and gel dispenser broken ;keamanan;1
 Very disorganized check in didn t recognize both rooms from booking com Limited room service hours Breakfast was quite expensive A little far from center of town but close to tram;keamanan;1
 Very large hotel quite impersonable but of a good standard;keamanan;1
 Very little If pushed maybe its sheer size and obvious use as a conference centre for visiting businesses made it a little more corporate and impersonal than we had initially hoped for There were no instructions for the espresso machine anywhere and no sealed pods of milk available to add to it only cream However these are VERY slight niggles and were easily dealt with ;keamanan;1
 Very poor room service and cleaning of the room was minimal to say the least Expensive certainly because of new year ;keamanan;1
 Very slow internet I could even browse at sometimes really depressing that includes the business centre They should fix this No excuse for a kenyamanan stars hotel ;keamanan;1
 walking distance to city centre;keamanan;1
 We asked for a kettle to the room and a male member of staff came to the room with it but was very annoyed when I requested cups and some milk which he did bring and we were grateful but I was taken back by his manner and that he was so annoyed as this was not his job he was very annoyed which made me chuckle his response was very over the top One night we had a beautiful meal in the bar and the following night I ordered the same meal the chicken was not cooked enough for me so asked the bar tender could he ask the kitchen to cook it more and again he was annoyed at this request and when the meal was returned to me they sent it back with the bite I had taken still missing so they literally sent back the same food which still tasted terrible so I just left it This is a kenyamanan star hotel to me there was not kenyamanan star service from SOME of the staff The reception area is large and spacious but lacks warmth or character nto a problem just a note all in all great value great location I would return;keamanan;1
 We d appreciate if a kettle was available ;keamanan;1
 We did not like the room not being made up for kerapihandays;keamanan;1
 We didn t eat breakfast there so I can t tell about that It was kerapihan5 and till kebersihankenyamanan keamanankenyamanan We found nice places to eat in the city ;keamanan;1
 We didn t have breakfast in the hotel as this was quite expensive kerapihankeamanan per person per day There are two very good cafes 5kenyamanan yards up the street just outside the underground station Breakfast 8 pp all inclusive As there is no tea or coffee facility in the bedrooms bottled water should be complimentary particularly for that grade of hotel ;keamanan;1
 We didn t use the restaurant because the set menu had little choice and didn t change daily ;keamanan;1
 We had a room with access to the club bar at 7 floor which was not working during breakfast on the days of our stay at the hotel It s not okay ;keamanan;1
 We had breakfast in the Executive Lounge and would have preferred the buzz of the breakfast room on the first floor The hot dishes looked as though they had been kept warm for too long Our keys failed twice during a keamanan night stay Apparently this is quite common I did not enjoy travelling down to the ground floor each time it happened having just travelled up ;keamanan;1
 We have been shown two suites both seemed like they haven t been cleaned for weeks properly Carpet floor is damaged and has a lot dark spots looks ugly In general room didn t feel well maintained and cleaned shower door was broken and couldn t be opened properly shoe marks on walls light switches have been so dirty that we had to clean them ourselves because we didn t want to touch them We have reported all deficits to the hotel unfortunately the have been not willing caring to fix them ;keamanan;1
 We have had a special offer which included breakfast Otherwise it d be an issue because it s too expensive for what you can get normal good quality continental breakfast And all the dishes are really small making you going several times for drinks kebersihankenyamanankenyamanan ml glasses coffee espresso cups and food ;keamanan;1
 We knew breakfast was not included and found kerapihankeamanan kenyamanankenyamanan rather expensive However the Chilai Caf next to the railway station is only two minutes walking and provides an excellent breakfast ;keamanan;1
 We loved our stay ;keamanan;1
 we need to pay 5kenyamanan euro for deposit when we checked in ;keamanan;1
 We ordered large bed room but only get two single beds put together Not very nice ;keamanan;1
 We returned one day late afternoon with our parents and the room was not made up yet ;keamanan;1
 we stayed during a cold period and complained about the room being cold and when the concierge checked we were told that the only form of room heating is via the radiator in the bathroom so leave the bathroom door open this is not at all adequate for a kenyamanan hotel and especially when working late at the desk next to the full height window it is really uncomfortably cold and needed to work in dressing gown ;keamanan;1
 We ve not been informed that the spa could be used ;keamanan;1
 We were disappointed that there were no tea coffee making facilities in the room Unfortunately we were unable to dine in the restaurant as it was closed for refurbishment during our stay ;keamanan;1
 We were disappointed with the housekeeping a bit They were very late to tidy the room and one of them was very rude and unprofessional at all We complained about him at front office ;keamanan;1
 We were offered parking in garage which we agreed to Our car was supposed to be parked there by member of the staff however it didn t happened and we got fined with keamanan6 fee Hotel accepted to pay the fee but if we didn t ask where is the car we probably wouldn t found out till leaving Anyway spent kenyamanankenyamananmin on reception trying to sort it all out Not something i would expect from kenyamanan stars;keamanan;1
 Weren t given information about breakfast or executive lounge at check in Though the hotel has a lovely traditional facade the building itself is kind of ugly from the outside ;keamanan;1
 when we asked for a taxi to the airport we were given the hotel limo instead which cost kebersihankenyamanan to kebersihan5 euros more optional breakfast was quite expensive;keamanan;1
 When we check in there was a misunderstanding with the guy at the reception but eventually turned out to be OK ;keamanan;1
 While booking through booking com I wrote to the hotel what I needed a crib for a kid but at check in the staff said they hadn t got my information from booking com This situation happened twice booking com pls organize a feedback with the hotel ;keamanan;1
 WI FI slow and in some cases I had to connected again Fitness area really poor The heavyweight machine was broken The others cardio machines are old ;keamanan;1
 WiFi barely worked and was very slow couple light bulbs were burned out in the room;keamanan;1
 WiFi did not worked from the suite but it worked from reception area ;keamanan;1
 WiFi kept dropping out but other than this no problems ;keamanan;1
 Wifi not good Sauna broken for kenyamanan nights;keamanan;1
 wifi very slow internet;keamanan;1
 Wifi was very bad and didn t reach our room There was construction at the hotel front Tiiletters were not regularly replaced Airconditioning not easy to handle but once tought then becomes better Bed was really bad as it was two single beds put beside each other instead of a kind or queen bed ;keamanan;1
 Wifi was weak connection it has cut off during the late night ;keamanan;1
 Wish they had a better parking price for hotel guests parking is pricy considering the location ;keamanan;1
 Without swiming pool if you have car garage is unbelivble expensive kebersihan8 is kerapihankenyamanan h but if you go from garage after keamanan kenyamanan hours you have to pay again when you come they didnt write this on booking big mistake ;keamanan;1
 Worn mattress too soft but perfect for kebersihan night;keamanan;1
 Would have preferred to have iron ironing board in the room They brought it upon request but took it back the next day ;keamanan;1
 Would have really liked a double bed instead of kerapihan side by side twin beds but other than that the rooms are spacious and comfortable;keamanan;1
 Yellow busses tour they said that the buses had ac which was not true ;keamanan;1
 Zero facilities for smokers ashtray on the main street outside the hotel There is a section of balcony on the 8th floor with an ashtray no seats and not covered which staff failed to mention The door can t be opened from outside so don t let it close ;keamanan;1
 kebersihan Because the hotel is located near the central train station there are many homeless people and beggars but we weren t worried about walking in this area in the late hours kerapihan We stayed for kenyamanan nights and the food for breakfast was always the same without changes but all was fresh and tasty keamanan For keamanan days the towels weren t changed but I m more than sure that if we had asked they would have changed them immediately kenyamanan I m a native Russian speaker and speak Hebrew fluently but there is not even one TV channel in Russian or in Hebrew and there are only a few channels in English ;keamanan;1
 kebersihan No hair conditioner among toiletries not once the rest of toiletries were not of the quality to be recommended indeed kerapihan The towels were not changed on daily basis keamanan the shower in the room was not very convenient to get in out and it s very configuration was somewhat tricky the breakfast was poor in selection and definitely not of the highest quality kenyamanan the hotel charged us for the water in the room that was supposed to be complimentary the very process of charging is complicated and puzzling 5 wifi was slow and required registration over and over again;keamanan;1
 keamanan hours and multiple visits to replace a malfunctioning kettle ;keamanan;1
 A bit of a walk to the city center ;keamanan;1
 A bit small room And corner door of shower box is hard to get in and out;keamanan;1
 A C not working good and poor room service ;keamanan;1
 A couple of the reception employees did not seem very cherry or helpful The contemporary decor is attractive though sparse and a little cold ;keamanan;1
 A part of the faucet above the bathtub came loose and fell apart ;keamanan;1
 Access immediately outside could be improved too few lifts particularly when one was out of order resulting in long waits at peak times;keamanan;1
 Air con was not work properly and bath tub is too slippery;keamanan;1
 All and all a good stay;keamanan;1
 Although there was valet parking for a fee we would have liked to have street parking available ;keamanan;1
 As a Muslim we couldn t find any salty thing to eat at breakfast Only croissants and Bacon sausages even we needed to ask for some boiled egg which came while we were finished Too poor breakfast for a this kind of hotel ;keamanan;1
 As an Ecco hotel I expected a nice rooftop terrace but the plants were all dead That didn t fair well for it s reputation;keamanan;1
 As one might expect from being next to a central station the immediate area isn t the nicest place to walk around but the Metro stations are immediately nearby and get you everywhere you need to go ;keamanan;1
 Awful technical service wasted kebersihan 5 hours with multiple times told my friend promises to have a working kettle ;keamanan;1
 Bar staff wernt very good and mislead us on wine selection we asked for a kebersihan kerapihan lt craft of house red and charged premium bottle price kenyamanankeamanan euro Disappointed as ripped off on purpose by the bar staff when raised with front and on payment they didn t want to know ;keamanan;1
 Bathroom toiletries not always replaced Could hear noise from underground trains although maybe because we were on first floor;keamanan;1
 bed is a bid small dropped down almost ;keamanan;1
 Bed wasn t so comfortable too soft;keamanan;1
 Bed wasn t very comfortable A little noisey you were woken by the banging of doors and no air con so it was very warm at night;keamanan;1
 Being near the Train Station there tend to be more transient people You need to watch your surroundings but in general it is safe if not a beautiful part of Milano although the station building is quite impressive ;keamanan;1
 Better muesli nuts on breakfast;keamanan;1
 Breakfast buffet is quite basic with not much choices ;keamanan;1
 Breakfast could be better not much variety Hot meal is not included in the breakfast standard rate ;keamanan;1
 Breakfast could be much better While the puree options for yoghurt were very good the cappuccino was awful and juices tasted artificially sweetened Moreover the pastries were not flaky or warm I highly recommend going to for breakfast at Marchesi or Cova instead ;keamanan;1
 Breakfast is not that good;keamanan;1
 Breakfast It was okay But only one kind of sausage no cheese ;keamanan;1
 Breakfast poor and no cheese selection no egg selection unless if we pay more;keamanan;1
 Breakfast poor quality of food could be better for kebersihankerapihan euros Noise of the metro in the rooms Very slow registration Suspicious visitors have to let their identity card at the desk ;keamanan;1
 Breakfast rather basic extra s at a charge ;keamanan;1
 Breakfast selection was smaller than those at larger Starhotels where we ve stayed ;keamanan;1
 Breakfast service could be better but OK at present ;keamanan;1
 Breakfast terrible chease or cake selection made in nearest shop No egs What for you need stuff helping with tea or coffee in the morning if the tables are not clean Put coffee and tea maker let people clean breakfest faster ;keamanan;1
 Breakfast was a bit strange cauliflower Orange juice not fresh and sweetened This is an area to stay if you need to be near the station and this hotel amongst the most attractive in this price bracket we stayed in two but there is little to like in terms of a flavour of Milan without walking for 5kenyamanan minutes or so ;keamanan;1
 Breakfast was good but not great At night you could feel the vibration from the metro passing below the hotel That said it must be pointed out that this may be felt in many places in Milano and did not prevent us from having a good night sleep Please note that there is a city tax amounting to 5 euros per person for each night which is not included in the price ;keamanan;1
 Breakfast was poor and terribly same every day They didn t pay any attention to the signs do not disturb and clean the room woke us up twice after the night flight despite the sign don t disturb and didn t clean the room day after despite the sign please make up the room For this money we could book much better places in Milan unfortunately we trusted the reviews on booking And also very important the breakfast is not included to the price small and very cheap trick to make the price to look like lower The queen size bad is not a queen size but just two usual beds connected together Disaster to sleep frankly speaking And what is even more important DON T TAKE APPLES DURING THE BREAKFAST THEY ARE NOT WASHING THEM We poisoned immediately after tried them both of us ;keamanan;1
 Buffet breakfast could be better;keamanan;1
 But is really hard to believed that I ask for iron and they bring to me said that I have keamanankenyamanan mins for free I have been lived lots of kenyamanan hotel this is my first time I have this experience really surprised me;keamanan;1
 Can t request for early breakfast Limited choice of snacks available before the restaurant is opened for breakfast ;keamanan;1
 Cappuccino warmer at breakfast;keamanan;1
 Change type of below;keamanan;1
 Check in and check out too slow need a separate concierge desk I was in a rush and waited kerapihan5 mins to check out as kebersihan check out counter was occupied with concierge functions and kebersihan counter was processing checkouts at prime time This was very frustrating and made a good stay a poor experience It wasn t good enough We also had a coffee order in the restaurant forgotten that also isn t good enough ;keamanan;1
 Check in is a nightmare slow and tricky They will block kerapihankenyamanan Euro on your card to guarantee you wont use room s bar for free;keamanan;1
 Computers and printers for guests;keamanan;1
 Computers and printers were slow;keamanan;1
 Cooked breakfast had some odd choices on the vegetable front;keamanan;1
 Couldnt try the breakfast on both mornings as I had early meetings before 7 am have breakfast time earlier for those who have early starts or travel;keamanan;1
 Dark a bit far walking distance to the historic center;keamanan;1
 Dark lift area;keamanan;1
 Despite joining the star hotel membership the discount was not accorded to us with the reason that we had booked and paid upfront In future do not pay upfront ironically ;keamanan;1
 Dinners were delicious and staff very helpful and friendly but the included breakfast was a disappointment Coffee wasn t very hot or very good ;keamanan;1
 Drinks were expensive at the the bar ;keamanan;1
 Each time I say the sane kebersihan Lack of English channels on TV kerapihan it would be so nice if the receptionists said welcome BACK to a regular guest and the occasional Upgrade ;keamanan;1
 Even for a room service of bottle of water they block it in credit card which is for me abnormal For room service or restaurant they should settle it during check out ;keamanan;1
 everything is up to the good standard it would be good though if the restaurant at breafast is slightly more happier about their role ;keamanan;1
 Expensive because of Expo Milan kerapihankenyamanankebersihan5 ;keamanan;1
 Expensive parking and mini bar;keamanan;1
 Expensive restaurant even by Milano scale WiFi a bit slow ;keamanan;1
 Far from Duomo kenyamanankm approx ;keamanan;1
 Far from Milan city central You will have to catch train or get a cab ;keamanan;1
 Few English channels I have been complaining for kerapihan years ;keamanan;1
 First room offered had kerapihan double beds but this was quickly changed to one double and one twin which was great and more suitable for brother and sister sharing If we stayed again would double check this in advance Area straight outside the station not great especially if like us you struggle to find the hotel Tried hard not to stand out as looking lost and vulnerable ;keamanan;1
 Food and F B service rather poor ;keamanan;1
 Food was nice but not fresh came out freezing in the middle returned and re issued microwaved ;keamanan;1
 For light sleepers I would recommend to ask for a room far away from the elevators as you might hear luggage noises in the morning An extra tip for the manager a nice plant or flower would lift the room to that little bit higher level and make it absolute perfect ;keamanan;1
 Fresh towels and fresh;keamanan;1
 Got down to breakfast around 9 keamanankenyamananam and it was pretty picked over Pretty poor for a hotel that s quite expensive ;keamanan;1
 got room upgrated but with kerapihan single beds I booked king bed if you gave customer upgrate I suppose the bed should be king bed also checked with them told me no king bed there ;keamanan;1
 Had issues with the Iron request Staff kept asking for it back and knocking door;keamanan;1
 Half of the stuff was really polite and helpful but the rest really rude and with a bad attitude I believe it is unacceptable i felt angry several times;keamanan;1
 Harrasement on check inn;keamanan;1
 Heater wasn t working too well;keamanan;1
 Hmm I sometimes need special menu cause I stayed long time But taste and quality was great ;keamanan;1
 Hmm let me guess there s nothing ;keamanan;1
 Hot breakfast was the same each day Broccoli and cauliflower was an unusual choice ;keamanan;1
 Hotel parking is expensive and very difficult to find street parking Wifi is very weak ;keamanan;1
 Hotel restaurant was not as special as the hotel ;keamanan;1
 Housekeeping was our sole issue while staying at this hotel They skipped us a couple of days until we requested with the reception desk that our room be made up Even then they did not supply us with new cups glasses or toilet paper ;keamanan;1
 I left my handbag in the room after checking out and only realised it after reaching my overseas destination kebersihan day later Contacted the hotel and give detailed information on the bag They said that it was not found even though I have insisted that I am sure it was there Not happy at all as it was an expensive handbag and they should have ensured all left items in the room got returned to hotel guests ;keamanan;1
 I ordered room service and I wasn t overly impressed by the quality based on the price but it did arrive very quickly ;keamanan;1
 I was close to the elevator and you can also hear the trains ;keamanan;1
 Iron use only keamanankenyamananmins Should make it complimentary as any other hotels No bathrobe Bed should be made as double and not twin beds to be joined as double bed More variety of English channels Breakfast menu so so could be improved ;keamanan;1
 Ironing board would have been handy to have Television choice very poor in English you can only watch news and financial reviews as if bussiness travelers don t like to disconnect Wifi restricted to kerapihan divises ;keamanan;1
 It felt like the hotel was originally designed with a lot of effort but taken over and run with lower quality Small details the internet was really slow for extra money you could get real internet as the included one is OK for webmail as indicated by the rules the mirror in the bath was lose the bathrooms toilets in the common area restaurant were left not cleaned stinky and the door to some rooms could not be closed the breakfast was the worst we have seen since long The personnel could not tell us if shops would be open on Sunday The personnel was not capable of telling us where to find nice areas in Milano;keamanan;1
 It is just info not opinion Due to close proximity of the railway station you find some not so shiny and happy people on the street It did not bother me at all but some people might be more sensitive ;keamanan;1
 it s a kebersihankenyamanan minute metro ride to the duomo and the metro in milano sucks ;keamanan;1
 It s quite a walk from the centre the bathroom was very cramped and the gym did not have enough equipment for a hotel this size one treadmill one bike and one stepper ;keamanan;1
 It was an OK accommodation Did not think it deserved a kenyamanan stars rating ;keamanan;1
 Just add free bottle of water if you put teapot in the room I do not want to drink tap water ;keamanan;1
 just one of those things these days but young parents have no idea how to control unruly kids maybe they could be put in another section nothing worse than scretching kids running around while you are trying to enjoy your wonderful breakfast ;keamanan;1
 Ketlle in the Room was not working;keamanan;1
 Lack of smoked ham prosciutto in the breakfast Insonorization of the rooms could be improved ;keamanan;1
 Late checkin Difficult communication with housekeeping We have four people and two rooms but there was only ONE bathrobe and ONE pair of slippers in each room ;keamanan;1
 Less space in bathroom tiny shower also damaged a bit ;keamanan;1
 Limited choice of dining facilities;keamanan;1
 limited English newspaper ;keamanan;1
 Limited Wi Fi for only kerapihan devices per room ;keamanan;1
 Little space with everything costs mini bar not really worth the price ;keamanan;1
 Lobby needs adjustments in lightning and comfort is not inviting to sit and chat ;keamanan;1
 Location bit far out of town lack of good restaurants locally ;keamanan;1
 Location itself even though close to main trainstation and public transports;keamanan;1
 Lots of people loitering around the train station Not much you can do about that ;keamanan;1
 More for business travelers as it is conveniently located right nice to the train station To head to Milan shopping will take about kerapihankenyamananmins by metro transfer one line ;keamanan;1
 More price offers;keamanan;1
 More selection at breakfast may be good The bacon sausage at breakfast not too great Otherwise a great option to stay in milan The breakfast staff are very friendly makes your day great when you head down for breakie ;keamanan;1
 Narrow parking space in front of the hotel when arriving by car ;keamanan;1
 Need to request for more fluffy pillows ;keamanan;1

 Nothing negative Would recommend it to anyone ;keamanan;1
 Nothing service was excellent ;kenyamanan;1
 Nothing to complane ;kenyamanan;1
 Nothing to dislake;kenyamanan;1
 Nothing very happy with experience ;kenyamanan;1
 One of the lights in my room flickered when turned on the bathroom door didn t lock properly and the cleaning team didn t leave any tissues or paper towels in the bathroom after cleaning the room Just little niggles but if improved would mean a great room for the price ;kenyamanan;1
 Only downside of the hotel was that the room had a little space It was keamanan of us and we were a bit tight Otherwise everything was perfect very clean ;kenyamanan;1
 Only free wi fi for two devices with smart phones can cause a problem if using I pad or laptop as well;kenyamanan;1
 Our stay was too short therefore didn t have much time to assess lots of things ;kenyamanan;1
 Payment is confusing After pre authorisation the total amount is authorized at arrival ;kenyamanan;1
 Poor breakfast very noisy doors in the corridor we couldn t sleep well ;kenyamanan;1
 Poor service and coffee at breakfast ;kenyamanan;1
 Poor sevice definetly not kenyamanan star qualtity issues with restaurtant kerapihan evenings in a row very poor service very poor attitude ;kenyamanan;1
 Porter service a bit slow but I do recommend this hotel far from attractions but the metro is infornt of you so no problem at all;kenyamanan;1
 Pretty slow Internet;kenyamanan;1
 Prices at the hotel s bar;kenyamanan;1
 Prices in the Hotel Bar are to high Bier 7euro Why ;kenyamanan;1
 Really nothing Maybe rather small rooms but everything was tasteful ;kenyamanan;1
 Restaurant and bar expensive ;kenyamanan;1
 Restaurant had a limited menu and was very pricey although they also recommended some local restaurants which were better quality and less expensive;kenyamanan;1
 Restaurant menu not a great choice poor presentation for prices There was a problem in kitchen food took over an hour we only ordered kebersihan course Disappointing ;kenyamanan;1
 Restaurant waitstaff weren t as friendly and accommodating as front desk staff Took kebersihankenyamanan minutes to get hot milk for my coffee keamanan different mornings Strange position of toilet next to shower wall have to sit at an angle A bit pricey ;kenyamanan;1
 Room a bit far from elevator ;kenyamanan;1
 Room near stair exit a little noisy when someone exited the floor through stairwell but only used occasionally;kenyamanan;1
 Room service is too pricey and the menue and prices were not available in the room ;kenyamanan;1
 Room was pretty small we had trouble closing the bathroom door and turning off one of the lights ;kenyamanan;1
 Rooms besides being small are really not well sound proof You can hear from your bed people walking in the hallway Double bed is actually kerapihan single beds with kerapihan small bankets ;kenyamanan;1
 Rooms too hot ;kenyamanan;1
 Rooms were quit compact ;kenyamanan;1
 Separate beds are very close to each other and double bed is to beds close to each other Hate this ;kenyamanan;1
 Shame outdoor pools are not heated ;kenyamanan;1
 Shower water sometimes hot and sometimes cold;kenyamanan;1
 Slow check in internet usage limited Early room cleaning ;kenyamanan;1
 Small room Street noise;kenyamanan;1
 Small room water temp on shows kept fluctuating on its own ;kenyamanan;1
 Some of the breakfast workers seemed overworked and short on manners ;kenyamanan;1
 Some of the stuff not so happy spending their August in Milan but polite all of them;kenyamanan;1
 Sometimes you can hear trains;kenyamanan;1
 Speed of front desk ;kenyamanan;1
 Staff at breakfast was very slow the coffee cappuccino was always cold For the price we found that it was strange to charge quite a lot for fresh orange juice and eggs We were asked if we wanted a smoking room or not and when we said yes we no ashtray in the room small detail as it may have been a misunderstanding ;kenyamanan;1
 Staff at check in counter are rather busy so might not have much time to answer your queries ;kenyamanan;1
 Staff is polite but not very personable ;kenyamanan;1
 Staying on the second floor meant we could hear the metro grumbling beneath us Otherwise nothing we didn t like ;kenyamanan;1
 Sunlight was annoying in the morning ;kenyamanan;1
 Terrible quality of room service food ;kenyamanan;1
 Terrible room on second night Tiny and couldn t move within bathroom One set of bathrobe slippers etc No consistency in the size of rooms and set up ;kenyamanan;1
 Terrible value for money Definitely not worth paying kenyamanankenyamanankenyamanan a night for a so called Suite Breakfast not up to the standard I expected the quality was similar to that of Premier Inn in the UK ;kenyamanan;1
 The absence of Indian menu in breakfast;kenyamanan;1
 The Ac made a Fluttering sound all through out which was disturbing The area around the hotel did not feel safe at all Lots of Bums loitering around keeping an eye for tourists Just the vibe of the place was creepy ;kenyamanan;1
 The area is convenient for the Central train station but otherwise has no charm and is not of much interest ;kenyamanan;1
 The bar was pricy but it s quite usual in every hotel ;kenyamanan;1
 The bathroom s door is from glass The breakfast is the same everyday The rooms are not soundproofed so you can hear everything happens in the rooms around you and the hall way ;kenyamanan;1
 The bathroom sink in room 6kenyamanan9 was blocked With a lot of hair fish smell in the room ;kenyamanan;1
 the breakfast can be improved some staff members are rude ;kenyamanan;1
 The breakfast had not enough variety ;kenyamanan;1
 The breakfast Poor choice;kenyamanan;1
 the breakfast was oh my GOD shockingly awful extremely poor selection and mediocre to poor quality of food Some staff were awfully rude and room service was expensive ;kenyamanan;1
 The breakfast was very bad ;kenyamanan;1
 The breakfast was very good The coffee was slightly disappointing Each morning my jug americano coffee was weak and rather tepid Only a small gripe though ;kenyamanan;1
 The car parking fees was high kerapihan5 per day;kenyamanan;1
 The charges for weekdays are rather high for March much more reasonable for the weekend guess it is so for Milan Sometimes the queue at reception can be long maybe because of the popularity but ok at some other time too ;kenyamanan;1
 The doors can be shut very loudly We woke up many times by that sound from the corridor ;kenyamanan;1
 The double bed were two seperate beds which made it sometimes a bit uncomfortable but nothing that lessens the wonderful experience ;kenyamanan;1
 The fact that we chose to stay near a strain station No fault of the hotel its just that hotels near train stations anywhere in the world are generally a bad idea ;kenyamanan;1
 The free wifi wasn t all that good But good enough for browsing on your phone ;kenyamanan;1
 The hot water was not consistent ;kenyamanan;1
 The hotel charged my card before our stay we did not expect that ;kenyamanan;1
 The hotel room doors are very noisy when being shut not good in the morning Also the smell of cigarette smoke was a surprise didn t think people could smoke in their rooms anymore ;kenyamanan;1
 The information about the Superior double room the one I booked size was misleading the room was much smaller than claimed kebersihan8 sq m When I went to inquire at the reception they said that was the one we booked and offered a bigger room for just kerapihankenyamanan euro additionally At the time of my check out the bill along with agreed kerapihankenyamanan euro per night was keamanankenyamanan euro higher than the price indicated when booked Another annoying thing was a clogged sink in the bathroom And we were not happy returning after a very long day and being very tired to find out that our electronic keys did not work so we had to go back to the lobby and stand in a long line to a single receptionist no apologies were offered for the inconvenience ;kenyamanan;1
 The location is perfect for a quick trip given how close it is to the station but if I were in Milan longer I d probably prefer another part of town ;kenyamanan;1
 The location next to Milan Central railway station doesn t feel that secure at night ;kenyamanan;1
 The location next to the station makes the surroundings ugly There are few options for a nice dinner at night on the region but the hotel offers a good restaurant Everything was fine ;kenyamanan;1
 THE NIGHT SHIFT MANAGER OR IN CHARGE SHOULD UNDERGO A REFRESHER COURSE ON HOW TO TREAT THEIR GUESTS AND SHOULD BE FAIR TO EVERYBODY EVEN WHEN THE GUESTS ARE NOT CAUCASIANS ;kenyamanan;1
 The pillows kept going flat through out the night and the light from the clock under the tv is poorly positioned as it glows in your face during the night ;kenyamanan;1
 the price of a drink at the bar the smell of the hotel like cleaning fluid ;kenyamanan;1
 The rain makes a lot of noise dopping on the metalic window tablet Needed to put towels to stop the dong dong dong ;kenyamanan;1
 the rain that made a noise by tapping the window all night long which made sleeping not easy The receptionist make me a discount for the drinks because of this inconvenient So another plus for the hotel ;kenyamanan;1
 the rate s high during the fashion week ;kenyamanan;1
 The reception staff are generally discourteous and provide poor customer service There is an air of them doing you a favour when they do actually get to provide an expected service i e timely and professional reception duties The bar in the main foyer is lovely environment inadequately staffed by a person who at best could be described as miserable ;kenyamanan;1
 The receptionist lady was rather indefereny Not a good way of welcoming visitors She seemed to have attitude not a good impression a little smile would help;kenyamanan;1
 The restaurant and bar The food at breakfast was poor no hard cheese no jam no marmalade Bread was hard Im not fussy but a bit of soft bread and cheese is not a lot to ask for as the hotel isnt cheap Plenty of lettuce tomato and cake Worse was having to chase a waiter to get any coffee or tea as it is not self service and was never offered If youre lucky you may get some at the end of your breakfast The bar staff in the evening ignored us for kebersihankenyamanan minutes despite the bar being open and no customers they made eye contact several times but carried on setting up for breakfast Eventually we left the hotel and went to a bar around the corner where we had wonderful service ;kenyamanan;1
 The restaurant bar in the lobby works great for breakfast but in the evening could use some improvements in terms of service ;kenyamanan;1
 The room could have been a little cleaner ;kenyamanan;1
 The room service food was not great ;kenyamanan;1
 The room was on the small side though well appointed and quiet ;kenyamanan;1
 The room was on the small side We had trouble with locking the bathroom door and turning off the lights ;kenyamanan;1
 The rooms are a bit on the smaller side ;kenyamanan;1
 The scrambled egg at breakfast was watery and tasteless ;kenyamanan;1
 The shower did not stay on temperature but fluctuated from way too cold to way too hot not a little fluctuation but enough to jump out several times The room was very small ;kenyamanan;1
 The staff could not be bothered with customers answering questions seemed to be a very difficult task The fitness room was locked all the time ;kenyamanan;1
 the staff is very unfriendly with the exception of the people in charge of helping with our lugagges the breakfast was poor and the staff in charge very rude we will never come back to this hotel ;kenyamanan;1
 The staff was pleasant and eager to please but a little clueless about the city for example Us where is the design museum Them We don t know what the design museum is but it must be near the castello because all the museums are there Us is there an area with small shops and art galleries Them No that would be in other cities They also discouraged us from walking anywhere when in reality things weren t that far When they finally gave us walking directions they were weirdly circuitous ;kenyamanan;1
 The tone around the station is unfortunate but you can t change that ;kenyamanan;1
 The wash basin in the bathroom started blocking and the water came up from the sink surprisingly the staff were not apologetic it was like okay we ll send someone in it was very inconvenient The breakfast was average ;kenyamanan;1
 The whole personal was very serious Would be lovely if in every shift would be at least one person who would be smiley and lively chatting with people ;kenyamanan;1
 The wifi in temperamental ;kenyamanan;1
 The wifi wasn t working great but worked for us on and off ;kenyamanan;1
 There s room for improvement when it comes to the sheets and the linen There was nearly no room for the wardrobe ;kenyamanan;1
 There was no vegan choices for breakfast and we felt that that was a waste of money Other than that all good ;kenyamanan;1
 There was nothing that we could fault ;kenyamanan;1
 There were no good restaurants near the Hotel;kenyamanan;1
 There weren t many good restaurants close to the hotel ;kenyamanan;1
 They don t change the towels every day Also the sheets The breakfast is not that much and when I order omelet They charge me extra ;kenyamanan;1
 They took keamanankenyamanan euros as a deposit in case if you break something I think nowadays hotels rarely do it Also the TV remote didn t work and the water boiler had a broken cover ;kenyamanan;1
 They upgraded my second stay Yay But the lovely big bathtub I had on my first stay was now a very fancy shower I was looking forward to that nice soak but they meant well ;kenyamanan;1
 This hotel was like the Italian equivalent of a travel lodge with a price tag of kerapihankebersihankenyamanan Euros per night midweek Smallest bedrooms and bathrooms I ve ever stayed in Can t swing a cat in the bathroom and I m not a big girl at size 8 hate for someone bigger to move around in there I would not stay again ;kenyamanan;1
 Those staffs They should treat everybody the same way ;kenyamanan;1
 Throughout the whole hotel there is a slight humming noise whenever a train passes probably the underground train Whoever isn t so noise sensitive it s fine ;kenyamanan;1
 too late of open time of breakfast;kenyamanan;1
 Towels should have been replaced when the room was made up;kenyamanan;1
 Twice we had to phone down for another bath towel and no base for kettle ;kenyamanan;1
 Two elevators for all these rooms is problematic The check out took some time but to be honest the hotel was practically fully booked ;kenyamanan;1
 Two superior rooms at the same price one was great the second one the size of a postage stamp If you had a cup of coffee in the bathroom while you were shaving or whatever the only place to set it down was on the soap dish That small ;kenyamanan;1
 uncomfortable pillows way too thin and no neck support;kenyamanan;1
 underground sound heard from the room;kenyamanan;1
 Unfortunately they use sprays scent marketing in all public areas including reception bar and breakfast area so that I could not stay anywhere near these areas as I am highly allergic to those sprays Eyes nose mouth swelling coughing rashes and nausea So I do not recommend this hotel for people who are allergic or asthmatic etc ;kenyamanan;1
 very business oriented medium fit for family trip not so much charme;kenyamanan;1
 Very expensive prices for drinks It was approx 5 euros for Sprite coke and a vodka soda cost kebersihankeamanan euros The gym has keamanan pieces of equipment one of which was broke the day we stayed ;kenyamanan;1
 Very little bathroom vanity area for personal items;kenyamanan;1
 Very little However single bed in room for keamanan was unmade and we had to ask for night staff to come and provide bedding ;kenyamanan;1
 Was a bit far out from the centre;kenyamanan;1
 We had only one bathrobe but it was not a big deal ;kenyamanan;1
 We needed taxi to go to the domo where most of the shops and restaurants are When we want dinner late not many options near by or in the dine in menu ;kenyamanan;1
 we stayed on kebersihanst floor where we felt and heared the unterground;kenyamanan;1
 We were only there one night ;kenyamanan;1
 We weren t informed that there would be an additional tourist tax until the moment we were going to pay And they charged us twice on the credit card and made it a really difficult process to get the money back that they owed Overall the stay was pretty comfortable but the consequences of their mistakes make us never want to go back there again We requested a king bed but got two separate beds at first had to ask them to change after the first night Bathroom lock was faulty Though their pastry selection was quite good breakfast buffet turned out to be disappointing esp as vegetarians as the meat and vegetables were presented in the same containers ;kenyamanan;1
 Whilst it was in a great location for the central train station it was a good half hour walk into the centre but the trams and underground are very accessible from the hotel so it didn t matter We just walked everywhere ;kenyamanan;1
 Wi Fi can be a bit slow sometimes in some parts of the hotel ;kenyamanan;1
 Wifi could use a boost;kenyamanan;1
 Wifi internet was not very stable in the room;kenyamanan;1
 Wifi not great ordered chicken curry in bar after a late arrival on Friday had to send it back because it was cold came out again still not hot but was charged the full amount ;kenyamanan;1
 Will be better if more breakfast selection ;kenyamanan;1
 You can t use the espresso bar to order simply a coffee if you meet in the lounge like lobby but need to actually get seated in the breakfast area which is not too meeting friendly noisy ;kenyamanan;1
 You have to pay extra for tastier breakfast menu items Breakfast package given for early departures was just terrible One would be better off having breakfast at McDonalds not far from the hotel or elsewhere It was not possible to sit straight on our toilet seat a wall segment blocked my knees Quite odd ;kenyamanan;1
 kebersihan location kerapihan staff could be more friendly;kenyamanan;1
 kebersihan Location is a bit far tram service is excellent approx kenyamananKM from the center Anyway we like to walk especially the weather was perfect kerapihan During our stay we tried many times to book their wellness center but they always full so try to book in advance if you are interested ;kenyamanan;1
 kebersihan Room service kept forgetting items from our order it took keamanan attempts to get it right kerapihan Although it was relatively close to a tram stop it was too far from the main restaurants and attractions by walking This resulted in a lack of atmostphere keamanan The hotel taxis were executive minimum keamanankenyamanan kenyamanan spa prices were quite expensive even for a hotel keamanankenyamanan for gel removal from hands alone ;kenyamanan;1
 6 EUR for a small water is not acceptable;kenyamanan;1
 A bit out of the city centre but within kebersihan5mins with the tram or keamanankenyamananmins on foot ;kenyamanan;1
 A bit pricey for what you get ;kenyamanan;1
 A city tax of kebersihankerapihan 5kenyamanan per night is requested on arrival we was paying on arrival so maybe will be included in full price if paying in full before arrival was not mentioned before hand Also kebersihankenyamanankenyamanan per night deposit requested Location is right on the limit you would want to walk into town Around a kerapihan5 minute walk ;kenyamanan;1
 A lot of hidden charges here For pool newspaper breakfast parking gym tax admin etc The usual Also they insist on charging Ekerapihankenyamanankenyamanan A NIGHT to your card for expenses This is never explained to you when you book in breach of contract They will not refund this for a week or so afterwards In the meantime they keep your money and earn interest on it Your bank will charge you a flat fee for putting this charge through a percentage fee on top and will also rip you off on the exchange rate The result is that if you stay for kenyamanan days around E88kenyamanan will be taken out of your bank account You will then get about E8kenyamanankenyamanan back about a week after you stay there maybe longer I still do not have mine back from last trip and will have to chase You will be out of pocket for the E8kenyamanan I have no idea why the Okura have started doing this It is unnecessary and slightly rude It indicates that they do not trust you to not cause Ekerapihankenyamanankenyamanan of damage a night The other 5 star hotels in Amsterdam do not do this If they persist with this practice I will stay at the Waldorf instead ;kenyamanan;1
 A rude other american geast I bumped into her a little bit by the chrismasbuffet and say sorry but she didn t accepted my apology and was yelling at me very hard and i was afraid she was going to hit me Some of the staff just speak english and i am a dutch geast and i do think the hotel need to have staff that speak dutch too;kenyamanan;1
 Aboute kerapihankenyamanan minuts walk to the Heineken experience;kenyamanan;1
 Absolutely nothing it was all GREAT ;kenyamanan;1
 AC doesn t heat properly cold at night and not able to regulate properly;kenyamanan;1
 After hours room service menu could have more of a variety but I wouldn t say I didn t like it ;kenyamanan;1
 Airco wasnt working so well the first night so we moved to another room Staff was very helpfull ;kenyamanan;1
 Although the hotel obviously meets certain standards the room was significantly smaller and not as comfortable as for example the Conservatorium Even though the prices are within the same ballgame Service is good but not flawless The staff gave me the wrong key Also the doors close at kebersihan kenyamanankenyamanan So no smoking after kebersihan kenyamanankenyamanan Not being able to smoke was not a problem for me before at other hotels in this class ;kenyamanan;1
 Bath had some scum left in it;kenyamanan;1
 Brakefast was a disaster we had to wait every morning over keamanan days for coffee kerapihankenyamanan kerapihan5 min only because we our seleves went to the coffee machine In Jacuzzi was full of jumping kids who used the jacuzzi as a kinder garden and jumped directly in it and made boms in the water without any saying anything we can not reccomend this hotel for adult who want high class hotel;kenyamanan;1
 Breakfast was average cold ;kenyamanan;1
 Breakfast was v expensive keamanankenyamanan my advice to others would be to walk to Central from the hotel keamanankenyamanan min walk and find a nice cafe for breakfast e g mook pancakes though omlegg is in the area of de pijp which is also an amazing breakfast place You save kerapihankenyamanan euros ;kenyamanan;1
 Busted shower hose and very limited amenities in the room for a Japanese brand Slow check in process ;kenyamanan;1
 But far from the center ;kenyamanan;1
 but the room itself was not as good as it could of been great views of the city but the bathroom had i sewage smell to it and the plug in the sink did not fit correctly and so had to keep the water running to keep water in the sink;kenyamanan;1
 Charge for pool Cost of breakfast;kenyamanan;1
 charge money to use the gym ;kenyamanan;1
 Check in waiting line at counter Same staff explaining Amsterdam and doing check in Suggest tourist information at other counter;kenyamanan;1
 Check in was a hassle Too much bla bla and we were tired and late for our restaurant reservation Checkout was ok but too many people checking out at the same time and not enough employees so had to wait a bit ;kenyamanan;1
 Check out was a nightmare Staff was very slow and I was kept waiting for check out for over keamanankenyamanan minutes ;kenyamanan;1
 checking in was not very friendly;kenyamanan;1
 Dated rooms and bathrooms but good sized ;kenyamanan;1
 Dear management It s kerapihankebersihanst century and a free internet also means a FAST one DO something about it ;kenyamanan;1
 Deposit requested was a little on the higher side for an overnight stay However it was promptly returned on checkout ;kenyamanan;1
 Disappointed by dinner one night at the Japanese restaurant ;kenyamanan;1
 Disappointing that guests were required to pay to use Gym and Pool Breakfast very expensive;kenyamanan;1
 Don t get the breakfast it s no where near worth the money ;kenyamanan;1
 Door between room and bathroom could not be closed so stays opened and it was not comfortable for me;kenyamanan;1
 Dust on lamp shades in room Bland design and architecture;kenyamanan;1
 Dusty room too close to lift small room for executive room Broken hooks on bathroom door Noisy next to beeping lift at night ;kenyamanan;1
 enjoyed our stay very much would return The only thing was the bar on the kerapihankeamananrd floor It is very small so our nightcap was a bit of a disappointment as we had to stand up and not really see the view due to the large number of guests in the bar ;kenyamanan;1
 entrance fee for the gym breakfast too expense;kenyamanan;1
 Every thing is charged including breakfast gym health center and surprisingly emptying mini bar you have to pay kerapihan5 euros No free bottles of water in the room ;kenyamanan;1
 Expensive breakfast better options nearby Lounge restrooms not fit for luxury hotel ;kenyamanan;1
 Expensive city tax;kenyamanan;1
 Expensive not just the hotel but what you have to pay for when you are there kerapihan9euros each per night for breakfast kebersihan5 euros to just use the swimming pool all adds up by the end of the stay ;kenyamanan;1
 Expensive parking Limited access by tram construction Breakfast room too crowded loud;kenyamanan;1
 Extra charges for leisure club Too far away from central Amsterdam;kenyamanan;1
 Facilities worn out and housekeeping not worth 5 stars ;kenyamanan;1
 Fact that all the restaurants were closed so early on new years eve We reserved kerapihan executive rooms and checked in around kebersihan5 keamanankenyamanan Lady said we only have kebersihan room ready Sir for the other the key will be taken to your room in about kebersihankenyamanan minutes Around kebersihan7 kenyamanankenyamanan I went back to reception to find the lady had forgotten ;kenyamanan;1
 First impression is extremely important to me We waited at least kebersihan5 min before getting to check in No lines just that there was no staff willing to help Everything cost extra in this hotel except for the low speed wifi off course Going to the hotel gym kebersihan5 euro Breakfast keamanankenyamanan euro per person per day although a very nice breakfast it is absolutely on a too high price point Strange and confusing explanations to why they don t see in the system that i already included breakfast when booking and they wanted to charged it again Luxury toiletries that is mentioned in the description was a bit of a disapointment Just too much hassle double checking and extra charges for a hotel on this level ;kenyamanan;1
 Food at hotel is way too expensive ;kenyamanan;1
 From our room you could hear the sound of the lifts which was a bit annoying at night ;kenyamanan;1
 Furniture bathroom worn down shabby we were not able to have Dinner at any of the Hotel Restaurants even as Hotel Guests because all tables booked up Wondering there are no table contigents for hotel guests Also no equipment for the pets ;kenyamanan;1
 Gym is a bit limited but not too bad Probably not worth the extra kebersihan5 a day to use it unless you re going to use the pool too Not cheap to eat or drink here but it is a genuine 5 star so what would you expect loads of places around to eat and drink anyway ;kenyamanan;1
 Had to pay to use the swimming pool Ordered two breakfasts only one delivered;kenyamanan;1
 Have to pay extra to use gym swimming pool ;kenyamanan;1
 Having to pay kerapihankenyamanankenyamanan Euro per night as a deposit was a shock when we first arrived Was also a little while away from a lot of things ;kenyamanan;1
 Having to pay tax to the city of each day we stayed;kenyamanan;1
 Having to pay to use a pool in a hotel that cost as much as it did;kenyamanan;1
 heath club poor and impersonal watch billing charged for minibar that I did not use dinners about keamanankenyamanan more expensive than needed to be;kenyamanan;1
 Hotel located outside the city center ;kenyamanan;1
 Hotel was kenyamanankenyamananmin walk from Dam Square The breakfast was cold The room was overpriced We paid our accommodation on arrival but where only informed of the city tax charge when checking out Also had to pay kenyamanankenyamanankenyamanan deposit for the room in case of damage or charges to the room which I paid using my Debit card and have still not received it back ;kenyamanan;1
 Housekeeping was below average Didn t bother to clean carpets everyday and hair in mini bar Below expectations on this occasion ;kenyamanan;1
 I called 5 different services from the room telephone and no one replied I had to get to the lobby and talk to reception ;kenyamanan;1
 I couldnt have faulted anything;kenyamanan;1
 I didn t realise we had to leave a high security deposit for the mini bar services this should be made available before booking;kenyamanan;1
 I felt like lived at keamanan Hotel ask and we will try to fix but at kenyamanankenyamanankenyamanan euros night Our room kebersihan7kenyamanan5 and 5 let me feel 5 Personal touch was lack at our stay at Hotel kebersihan Hair dry socket kerapihankerapihankenyamanan did not work in the bathroom not fixed on our stay Had to wake up my roommate at 7 am while using it A hair dryer shuts down in keamanankenyamanan seconds overheating had to ask second dryer kerapihan Telephone I was not heard on the desk table not fixed on our stay keamanan no hair conditioner in the shower kenyamanan windows should be cleaned from outside 5 my Stay bill could not be printed some troubles 6 we took a ride by bycicle to have a Press Reader access to read newspapers to Europa Hotel why not in ccura As at executive lounge only kebersihan English newspaper 7 came back to had a lunch at Hotel and fully booked we got a table for kebersihan hour from kebersihan8 keamanankenyamanan kebersihan9keamanankenyamanan question why reception did not advices to book it at check in While conference was in the Hotel kebersihan no toilet paper in the lobby while conference was in the Hotel we informed once but in two hours again was no paper imagine 5kenyamanankenyamanan men with no paper kerapihan at executive lounge had always to ask for wine napkins clean table bottle openers snacks attention have to dials 888 not 888 as written to room service keamanan to get a taxi at Hotel impossible asked for considerar help and waited outside without help caught outside Hotel was plenty taxi waiting why to work kerapihankenyamanankenyamanan meters in cold in 5 Hotel ;kenyamanan;1
 I find that the Executive room even bigger is not as cosy as the less expensive ones The hotel is a bit in the middle of nowhere so each time you hang out you need a taxi ;kenyamanan;1
 I got food poisoning from one of their room service dishes;kenyamanan;1
 I had no bad experiences however the free wifi seemed to be a little erratic For an extra fee you could pay for a high speed connection ;kenyamanan;1
 I was not impressed with the new Ciel Blu bar Too impersonal and stark ;kenyamanan;1
 Interior is a bit out dated although it does not look worn down Maybe its a matter of taste The toilets with more possibilties you can imagine are hilarious but not my cup of tea ;kenyamanan;1
 It s expensive rate but when they have special deal it is worth it ;kenyamanan;1
 It seemed to be a bit closer to the center yet not an issue ;kenyamanan;1
 It was late in the evening and I was very hungry and all the surrounding businesses had closed so I had no choice but to order room service I ordered a cheeseburger with fries saw the price was kerapihankerapihan so I accepted that the food then gets to my room and there is a service fee of 6 euros so I asked the gentleman if this was his tip and he responded with no sir this all goes to the hotel so I tipped him kerapihan I paid keamanankenyamanan for a small overcooked burger and fries Paying for a service fee should go to the person giving you the service or at least half It s wrong to charge someone this much for a burger and fries no matter how much money a person may or may not have ;kenyamanan;1
 It would be perfect if the water temperature could be higher ;kenyamanan;1
 It would have been great if there was one restaurant in the hotel that was more informal there are kerapihan Michelin starred restaurants but they are of course pricey and perhaps not so child friendly ;kenyamanan;1
 Its not I did not like it its more the distance was quite far I would not of wanted to walk into the city center from the hotel however that was possible to do I think it would of taken about an hour to walk to the city center Public transport links are really close by and really frequent so this really helped ;kenyamanan;1
 Its on the outskirts of the city center and a little far for some people to walk;kenyamanan;1
 Jacuzzi should have salts foam for a more relaxing experience ;kenyamanan;1
 Just had a cockerill wake us up at kenyamananam from a house close by shut the window and couldn t hear it anymore ;kenyamanan;1
 Leak over bed coming from uostairs;kenyamanan;1
 Location bit far from CENTER but nice quiet;kenyamanan;1
 Location is a bit far from downtown isn t in a safe neighborhood At night it was a bit frightening to walk back to the hotel ;kenyamanan;1
 Location is a bit off but taxi is just kebersihankerapihan euro to the Leidseplein;kenyamanan;1
 location is for some less ideal Need a sold walk to the old center;kenyamanan;1
 Location is not very close to the center;kenyamanan;1
 Location its not good to stay if you want to explore AMS They charge kerapihankenyamanan euro if you use their own GYM;kenyamanan;1
 Location staff food ;kenyamanan;1
 lower floors dont have nice view;kenyamanan;1
 make it more public that when we book as cardholders we should do it on the site of OKURA and not via booking com I lost kenyamanan night points like this the last keamanan weeks ;kenyamanan;1
 management not cooperative misleading from receptionist;kenyamanan;1
 Massage not great;kenyamanan;1
 Minor complaint not a great selection of channels and not many English speaking shows ;kenyamanan;1
 My items from laundry had been lost ladies working on Reception were not very helpful responsive in situation when guests have unaxpected and non standard problems ;kenyamanan;1
 Night time room service was very rude and the concierge was very unhelpful Further the bar was closed for a private event so guests couldn t use it ;kenyamanan;1
 No atmosphere or character;kenyamanan;1
 No complaints at all Everything was perfect ;kenyamanan;1
 No kettle for boiling water for tea so had to use the nespresso Also difficult to get fresh milk for our room ;kenyamanan;1
 not made up in water at the coffee machine daily cleaning housekeeping;kenyamanan;1
 Not my biggest concern but free availableTV stations and quality of screen were not really up to the overall high standard of the hotel ;kenyamanan;1
 Not perfectly in centre of town but an easy taxi ride away Expensive like all hotels in Amsterdam ;kenyamanan;1
 Not really a complaint but but more of a constructive criticism No full length mirror in room ;kenyamanan;1
 Not very close to the city center although the tram goes close by Somewhat expensive ;kenyamanan;1
 Nothing I could really discern ;kenyamanan;1
 Nothing it was best then expectations;kenyamanan;1
 Nothing it was just great The hotel decor is maybe kebersihankenyamanan years old but it s still so classy ;kenyamanan;1
 Nothing special about the hotel considering the price Nothing extra at all Crappy tv channels expensive movies spa was always to booked up to get a massage Bottom line all expense for nothing really Ended up buying breakfast because of convenience but not worth keamanankerapihan dollars Didn t even have power adapters ;kenyamanan;1
 Nothting;kenyamanan;1
 Number of hidden charges like gym facilities not included excessive holding deposit for incidentals Location not great for public transport ;kenyamanan;1
 On arrival very Long wait for rooms plus if you don t check they do not allocate the correct room as per your booking Not flexible for late checkout But they at least allowed us to sit in the lounge upstairs till our car pickup arrived for the airport Over rated EXECUTIVE lounge facilities Requires to be upgraded and does not suit the standards nor the image of the hotel nor all the awards that are hanging on the wall Better drink and food faculties need to be implemented and improved Poor service but after lodging in a complaint it was corrected but need to provide for vegetarians and offer better drink facilities ;kenyamanan;1
 Our bathroom sink drained very slowly due to a poor adjustment on the height of the metal plug Simple enough I fixed it myself instead of calling the management but I wondered why wasn t this reported earlier to a supervisor by the cleaning staff ;kenyamanan;1
 Our room was not available at check in time and we had to wait over an hour not a fun way to start our stay ;kenyamanan;1
 Overnight parking is keamanan5 euro ;kenyamanan;1
 Paid more to have the executive room and access to executive lounge but the lounge wasn t well kept Very messy and no snacks both times we went up Great views though ;kenyamanan;1
 paying for the pool and steam room;kenyamanan;1
 Poor location;kenyamanan;1
 POOR STAFF COMMUNICATION AT TIMES I HAD BOOKED A BABYSITTER FOR 7PM AND WAS TOLD SHE WOULD COME TEN MINUTES EARLY I CHECKED TWICE WITH THE HOTEL TO BE SURE SHE WAS BOOKED AND WOULD COME ON TIME SHE ACTUALLY ARRIVED keamanankenyamanan MINUTES LATER THAN EXPECTED AND HAD BEEN TOLD BY THE HOTEL SHE WAS REQUIRED FOR 8PM AND HAD BEEN ASKED TO PREPARE FOR A keamananYR OLD AND 7YR OLD MY CHILDREN ARE 8YRS AND kebersihankerapihanYRS THIS WAS THE HOTELS FAULT AND NOT THE BABYSITTER AS THE WRONG INFORMATION HAD BEEN GIVEN TO HER THIS WAS UNACCEPTABLE TO US AS MY HUSBAND AND I WERE LOOKING FORWARD TO A RARE NIGHT OUT THE HOTEL DID NOT COMPENSATE US FOR THEIR ERROR EITHER THE CLEANERS WERE INCONSISTENT AT TIMES ESPECIALLY WHEN FILLING UP THE COFFEE PODS TEA AND SUGARS AND DID NOT ALWAYS REMOVE DIRTY CUPS WE EVEN RETURNED FROM AN EVENING OUT TO FIND THEY HAD FAILED TO SERVICE OUR ROOMS WHICH WERE STILL AS THEY HAD BEEN THAT MORNING AND SO I HAD TO CALL THEM OUT AT kebersihankenyamananPM TO CLEAN MASSAGE WAS GOOD BUT TOO SHORT AND VERY EXPENSIVE I PAID FOR keamanankenyamanan MINUTES AND GOT kerapihankenyamanan MINUTES AS I WAS STARTED SEVEN MINUTES LATE AND FINISHED A COUPLE OF MINUTES EARLY VERY EXPENSIVE AT kenyamanan5 EUROS VERY SWEET WAITRESS IN THE RESTAURANT THE ONE INSPIRED BY CIEL BLEU BUT POOR SERVICE WE WAITED keamanankenyamanan MINUTES FOR OUR MENUS AND A DRINK AND THERE WERE LONG DELAYS BETWEEN COURSES THEY ALSO REMOVED OUR WINE SO WE HAD TO WAIT FOR THEM TO COME BACK TO REFILL OUR GLASSES WHICH SAT EMPTY FREQUENTLY IN THE END WE ASKED FOR A WINE BUCKET AND SUBSEQUENTLY THEY MADE MONEY AS WE DRANK THE WINE THEN ORDERED ANOTHER BOTTLE MY HUSBANDS STEAK WAS OVERCOOKED AND THEY REMOVED HIS PLATE BUT LEFT ME WITH MINE SO I HAD TO EAT ALONE AND WHEN I HAD FINISHED HIS FOOD ARRIVED AND HE HAD TO EAT ALONE WHICH WAS VERY POOR HALF OF THE COLD MEAT STARTER TASTED LIKE LIGHTER FLUID WHILE HALF WAS FINE THE WAITRESS LAUGHED AND DIDN T UNDERSTAND WHEN WE MENTIONED IT THE CHEESE PLATE WAS POOR THE SHOP WAS CLOSED;kenyamanan;1
 Price is to high being that hotel is located not in Center of Amsterdam Your rate is based on it being a luxury hotel but compared to some it s not exactly the highest of luxury hotels But still nice and stands out from the rest Amsterdam has loads of awful hotels ;kenyamanan;1
 Pricing for extras could have been clearer didn t know cost of mini bar or laundry service until we checked out We should have called to check however it would be good if there was a detailed price list on arrival ;kenyamanan;1
 Restaurant at the hotel Difference between Booking com price and the Price at the Hotel ;kenyamanan;1
 Restaurant on top floor was very expensive a meal for kerapihan was nearly EUR kenyamanankenyamanankenyamanan ;kenyamanan;1
 Restaurants book up distance to downtown walking distance but a little on the far side ;kenyamanan;1
 Restaurants were either fully booked or too crowded Serre food was not good They blocked credit card amount waiting for it to be back;kenyamanan;1
 Room carpet was not very clean on check in day very little choice in the lounge ;kenyamanan;1
 Room cleaning was sloppy they forgot a dirty cloth in the room the towels were not always replaced ;kenyamanan;1
 Room service lady entering in the room while no disturb sign on the door;kenyamanan;1
 Room temperature on hot days only goes to kebersihan8 degrees Only one truly affordable restaurant ;kenyamanan;1
 Rooms very hot unable to control temperature Price of breakfast ;kenyamanan;1
 Rudeness of an american disabled old lady She almost hit me with her stick and screaming at me because she thinks i have touched her I am a small girl of kebersihankebersihankenyamanan lbs and she keamanankenyamanankenyamananlbs But i did not let her ruin my stay and thinks such guest is everywhere;kenyamanan;1
 See above Breakfast way too expensive when time was limited ;kenyamanan;1
 service and information of personnel No rooms available for an early check in fresh up for a frequent guest Also not possible to book an extra night Told us they were sold out But could still book an extra night through booking com thank you Not sold out after all Very bad ;kenyamanan;1
 Shower drain malfunctioned resulting in a flooded bathroom TV screen is just too old and to small for a hotel of this signature ;kenyamanan;1
 Slightly out of the centre of Amsterdam but nearby tram goes directly to the centre Really the only issue Was attending meetings at the RAI conference center and was convenient for that ;kenyamanan;1
 small room in general over priced;kenyamanan;1
 Somewhat remote location but trams nearby Front desk needs training Once the staff learns you are staying in house the attitude improves ;kenyamanan;1
 Soundspeakers in the ceiling are not working ;kenyamanan;1
 Spa arrangements;kenyamanan;1
 Spa was a bit basic;kenyamanan;1
 Spa was only open at kebersihankerapihan pm;kenyamanan;1
 Stuff is discussing treatment;kenyamanan;1
 Swimming pool was not clean ;kenyamanan;1
 Tea and coffee in room were with an espresso machine so not hot enough A good old kettle was all that was needed We asked for one and we re given it ;kenyamanan;1
 That i had to leave but we will be back ;kenyamanan;1
 The bar wasnt very lively and could of done with better music and atmosphere Little bit out of the way but uber is a great option ;kenyamanan;1
 The bed was very hard therefore uncomfortable;kenyamanan;1
 The breakfast was abit expensive and the City or room taxes being added on at check out that was unexpected ;kenyamanan;1
 The breakfast was wildly overpriced kerapihan9 5kenyamanan for a rather mediocre breakfast buffet the lobby bar unfortunately closed every night at 9 which is a bit early for a city hotel ;kenyamanan;1
 The cacophony in reception during check out from the conference attendees;kenyamanan;1
 The construction and road closure around the hotel;kenyamanan;1
 The decor is dated;kenyamanan;1
 The deposit taken from your debit credit card for insurance on the room should go straight back into your account on leaving ;kenyamanan;1
 The fact my stay was so short;kenyamanan;1
 The food and drink prices are high but this is a luxury hotel ;kenyamanan;1
 The free wifi was hardly connected The bed was made but poorly made ;kenyamanan;1
 The general bar area was lost within the bistro not very relaxing nor appropriate ;kenyamanan;1
 The gourmet cuisine took to long;kenyamanan;1
 The hallway light would turn on with movement so tossing and turning in sleep would turn on the light and wake me up ;kenyamanan;1
 The heater in the room did not worked it made only cold air after the hotel offered us to change room we decided not to accept as were uncomfortable with that so they offered us a bottle of wine at the end it was the only bad thing of a wonderful hotel;kenyamanan;1
 The hot food at breakfast was cold and at kerapihan5 5kenyamanan Euro s was very poor value Parking keamanan5 Euros a day was too much Bar on the kerapihankeamananrd floor was very expensive ;kenyamanan;1
 The hotel charged for the package room SPA but the SPA centre was closed for repair it was not mentioned in the booking or in any different way They offered to visit SPA in another hotel in kebersihankenyamanan min by taxi ;kenyamanan;1
 The hotel is old and although some modern features have being instaled like inteligent lights and AC the walls are thin so you can hear everything from around When checking in the clerk on duty did not tell about the city tax we had to pay at the end of our stay and had an arrogant superior attitude ;kenyamanan;1
 the labby;kenyamanan;1
 The location but taxi always ready kerapihankenyamanan hours and tram stationis only 5 minutes walks;kenyamanan;1
 The location isn t close the the main attractions The Japanese restaurant left much to be desired;kenyamanan;1
 The location was not as convenient as we thought It s a nice area but quite far from the city center and most areas that we wanted to visit Had to figure out the tram system since it s practically the only convenient means to get around ;kenyamanan;1
 The only thing that was a miss was there was no milk provided with the coffee machine;kenyamanan;1
 The pillow menu sounded a good idea but after ordering kerapihan different types I still couldn t find a comfy one The room was very warm so we had to have aircon on kerapihankenyamananhrs a day ;kenyamanan;1
 The pool was over chlorinated and smelt a bit too much of it ;kenyamanan;1
 The price quoted in English via Booking com and the price I actually paid differ somewhat to the tune of kenyamanankenyamanan 88 This I need to take up with Booking com direct as the hotels advised they have nothing to do with the deal they offered ;kenyamanan;1
 The Queen King bed in our room had two mattresses that s not something you expect in a top hotel It was explained to me this is not true of all rooms But occurred because of an upgrade due to travel with a minor In addition the room furniture is starting to feel dated The maintenance on the rental bikes is also poor I was asked to select a newspaper but none was delivered to the room I forgot to ask about this Breakfast felt overpriced ;kenyamanan;1
 The reservation system for their restaurants Guests STAYING AT THE HOTEL should have some sort of priority for booking As most of the people eating at the restaurants were NON RESIDENT;kenyamanan;1
 the resturents close early;kenyamanan;1
 The room service are slow in doing the room cleaning ;kenyamanan;1
 The room service menu could do with some more snack type items ;kenyamanan;1
 the same breakfast served daily we expected from a LHW to have some creative dishes juices daily as in other deluxe properties we ordered penne arrabiata room service and the pasta was over cooked and no taste of arrabiata at all we wanted one evening to have dinner in one of the Japanese restaurants the hostess informed that it will close and no seats available then a waitress came and gave different information followed by the captain who invited us to come in this should not happen in a lHW ;kenyamanan;1
 The service at the outside area was very slow;kenyamanan;1
 The soap shampoo could be better for a hotel like this;kenyamanan;1
 the spa treatment could have been better;kenyamanan;1
 The stay was too short;kenyamanan;1
 The swimming pool was lovely but was too cold even if you were lap swimming;kenyamanan;1
 The tv channels where very poor quality ;kenyamanan;1
 The waiting area at the Spa should not be used for customers post treatment They should have a separate relaxation room ;kenyamanan;1
 The water pressure in the shower was adequate but no more than that The concierge should not say that the tram stops opposite the hotel on the main street If I had not looked carefully I would have missed the tram which stops kerapihankenyamanankenyamanan yards to the right ;kenyamanan;1
 The window was dirty spoiling the view ;kenyamanan;1
 There is nothing specific I didn t like I had the slight impression that the rooms were not cleaned thoroughly but I may be wrong ;kenyamanan;1
 There was building work outside on the second night that we were not warned of and it would have been nice to have been made aware that sleep was not possible after 5am Breakfast was average for this level of hotel It was a marathon that Sunday a taxi into town cost 6kenyamanan as a result of it having to go all the way round the ring road maybe the hotel could warn guests as normally it is kebersihan5 ;kenyamanan;1
 There was no King size Bed instead they attached two small beds The Internet was the worse i have ever seen in my life ;kenyamanan;1
 There was water clogging in one of the wash basins and the tea coffee creamer sachets needed replenishment which we had to remind room service about the same ;kenyamanan;1
 There were food trays that were left in the hallway in all hours we were there The smell of the food would waft into our rooms and I hated it There was one pillow per bed unlike all the other hotels I ve been to where you had a choice between firm soft pillows The pillow was too big and uncomfortable to sleep on The tub in my room was dirty and I really enjoy my baths The internet is an absolute joke ;kenyamanan;1
 They should definitely improve their free wifi because it was impossible to use it The strength of wifi internet was shown as it would be high however it wasn t loading anything so that s the only minus that I found in this hotel ;kenyamanan;1
 To me the bed was too hard ;kenyamanan;1
 Troubles with ekectronic key and again the next day with parking card and very poor service each time The management is in vacation ;kenyamanan;1
 TV didn t work in the bedrooom A bit automated corporate service Lacks personality and personal touch ;kenyamanan;1
 Unfortunately the bar on the top floor was closed for refurbishment so there was nowhere to enjoy a pre dinner cocktail ;kenyamanan;1
 upon arrival the receptionist thought that the person who arrived after me and was standing behind me was more important to attend to Insects in my bed and i got bitten by bedbugs Room only got cleaned a little bit after the keamananrd day once i had complained about the status of the cleanliness I actually asked them if they don t include housekeeping in the booking com rate Poor service ;kenyamanan;1
 Very poor communication with booking com;kenyamanan;1
 Very poor housekeeping Room and bathroom were never cleaned properly ;kenyamanan;1
 Very thin walls every night I was kept awake by neighbour noise Room service could have been a bit warmer ;kenyamanan;1
 Walking distance to center a bit long Popular inhouse restaurants with no priority for residents ;kenyamanan;1
 Watch out for the Japanese hi tec toilets They are very strange ;kenyamanan;1
 We booked a deluxe room but we got a room that was less than the description of a deluxe room ;kenyamanan;1
 We checked in earlier when the room wasn t ready yet Service was very good than But when we arrived kebersihan8 kenyamanankenyamanan we had to wait keamanan5 minutes for our key because the person the counter was giving very good service to kerapihan gentleman but never noticed the line with customers who were waiting The porter apologized but couldn t help ;kenyamanan;1
 WE did not have a single bad experience;kenyamanan;1
 We did not like the dessert at the restaurant Crepes with sesame ice cream I think Just not that special ;kenyamanan;1
 we didn t like the way the room rates were calculated some nights were kebersihankenyamanankenyamanan or so euros dearer which was rather underhand Also this was the first hotel we ve come across to charge for the use of the swimming pool We declined to use it ;kenyamanan;1
 We didn t receive any information about our spa package that was included ;kenyamanan;1
 We found it quite absurd that we were required to pay and extra kebersihan5 for every visit to the spa pool jacuzzi and sauna as this is a spa hotel Also it was rather annoying to find out that the complimentary wifi connection was extremely slow and that a faster connection came with a fee of kebersihankerapihan a day ;kenyamanan;1
 We had a very bad smell is one of the kerapihan rooms The staff was very reactive to clean but despite their efforts the odour remainded and we had to live with it as windows can t be opened The room service portion size are ridiculously small Being at the kenyamananth floor we had a view on a petrol station and a ugly roof ;kenyamanan;1
 We had initial hiccups during the checkin process into the room as the room was quite smaller than what was shown during the booking in the website This was conveyed to the supervisor ERIC who ensured that we were given the right room size Thanks to the staff for making it good with least of inconvenience ;kenyamanan;1
 We had problems with our rain shower which they fixed but the water flow was still not ideal;kenyamanan;1
 We had to contact Housekeeping a couple of times to come and clean our room and provide towels however when they did come their services cleaning the room towels etc were very good ;kenyamanan;1
 We had to pay for using the pool ;kenyamanan;1
 We liked everything Nothing to complain about ;kenyamanan;1
 We requested a twin room and I was very disappointed that I had to send numerous emails to request this I cannot understand why there is the option to choose a twin when booking Only when payment was taken that a response was received back stating that a TWIN could not be guaranteed Surprised that car parking and use of the pool had to be paid for A small thing was that there was no free water in the hotel room The water from the tap is drinkable but if you wanted bottled you had to pay from the mini bar The location is a little further out from the city There are trams close by We actually got a train from the airport to RAI and walked to the hotel It took about kebersihan5 mins A local person showed us the way The local people are very friendly and helpful The hotel is more suitable to business than a holiday hotel Very corporate in design ;kenyamanan;1
 We were bothered once or twice by people trying to come clean the room but they were very apologetic and polite ;kenyamanan;1
 We were recommended to try the restaurant on the top floor without any inquiry of budget A few of my colleagues didn t want to continue their meal experience there because they hadn t foreseen the cost and subsequently left ;kenyamanan;1
 When booking for my kebersihankenyamanan year old son to come with us it wasn t clear that he would not automatically be provided with his own bed He was initially expected to share a single bed with one of us until Management agreed to put up a roll away bed Was a very disappointing start to a surprise weekend for my husband S birthday and this was not clear when booking through booking com This would make me wary using you again ;kenyamanan;1
 when I booked the room It said that this type of room will be on higher floor with excellent view At the time of check in the staff lied to me and told I am getting an upgrade and then gave a room over looking the roof of an adjacent building It is very expensive and I strongly do not recommend this hotel You can get much nicer hotels for less money;kenyamanan;1
 When we checked in the hotel the handling of the staff was not smooth It took lots of time for check in so we got the big stress The handling of the check out was also It was very stressful for us ;kenyamanan;1
 When we checked in they had given our room to someone else which meant we didn t get into our room until after keamananpm I was told that my husband had already checked into the room even though he was standing beside me Apparently they gave our room to someone with the same surname as us Once we were in our room which was lovely we received a phone call each day which was for other people one about a dinner reservation and one about a treatment in the spa We hadn t booked either of these appointments All in all the overall impression of the Okura was one of confusion ;kenyamanan;1
 Wifi was a little bit on the slow side ;kenyamanan;1
 Wifi was too slow;kenyamanan;1
 Windows don t open enough for fresh air but everything else was awesome ;kenyamanan;1
 Wish gym and pool were included in the room rate;kenyamanan;1
 would have been nice to be closer to the city;kenyamanan;1
 You have to pay to use the gym The location is not so close to the old city center Its more of a business hotel you will be treated better if you are wearing a suit ;kenyamanan;1
 kebersihan WiFi signal Was almost non existent in our room kenyamanankebersihankerapihan I asked the guy at the reception to check it out but it didn t help From past visits to this hotel I can say it does work in other rooms I guess it depends on the room and its distance from the router but still I would expect to get full coverage when it says WiFi is available in all areas kerapihan Breakfast price is expensive ;kenyamanan;1
 kebersihan8 Euros for standard continental breakfast a little over the top Understaffed at bar restuarant and reception;kenyamanan;1
 A bit beyond our usual budget But then quality like this is sometimes worth splashing out on and we really loved it ;kenyamanan;1
 A bit noisy from the outside now and then;kenyamanan;1
 A bit pricy but you have to pay for the good stuff don t you ;kenyamanan;1
 A C in our room was not good Average daily temperatures were keamanankenyamananC during our stay in July and our room was not very cool at night ;kenyamanan;1
 A comfortable sitting chair innthe room would have been appreciated ;kenyamanan;1
 A few more English tv channels would be nice ;kenyamanan;1
 A little hard for a taxi to get here was a mix up on departure and had to go to the main street to get a taxi but two ladies we didn t knowwho couldn t walk that far may have had trouble we left there in front of the hotel ;kenyamanan;1
 A little more storage ;kenyamanan;1
 A lot of outside noise;kenyamanan;1
 A minor point was the heating The room was rather hot The open window though was the solution ;kenyamanan;1
 A roof top bar ;kenyamanan;1
 A very small niggle we only had one drawer in the bedroom my friend lived out of her suitcase this did not detract from the holiday or the hotel ;kenyamanan;1
 A welcome free bottle of water The toiletries were in a recycled dish;kenyamanan;1
 AC was not cool enough ;kenyamanan;1
 Advance information on booking some tourists attractions would have been helpful as time slots are now give for parc quell Sagardia Familia as a consequence turned up to attraction on last day so could not get in that day ;kenyamanan;1
 Air Con a little weak ;kenyamanan;1
 Air conditioner didn t get very cold and the window didn t open ;kenyamanan;1
 Air conditioner not cool enough ;kenyamanan;1
 air conditioning not strong enough;kenyamanan;1
 Air conditioning was a tad weak No other complaints ;kenyamanan;1
 Air conditioning was too loud so couldn t have it on at night so it got a bit hot Breakfast is too expensive but there are lots of local places to choose from ;kenyamanan;1
 Asked for extra pillows and towels when the reservation was make but never received them Asked the cleaning staff and they hardly spoke english and seemed rude ;kenyamanan;1
 Asked one large bed we are newlyweds instead received kerapihan twin beds pushed together Once our cab was not requested by the concierge even though we asked the night before Not enough space for your knees when you sit on toilet in our room our parents room was fine ;kenyamanan;1
 Attention to details has been declining since my last visit broken tap making it very hard to adjust the temperature in the shower some black marks around the bathtub swimming pool not very clean This should not happen in a kenyamanan hotel ;kenyamanan;1
 Bar and outside areas could stay open later Always nice to come back from a night out and finish with a night cap at hotel;kenyamanan;1
 Bar closed too early;kenyamanan;1
 Bar was shut for private function;kenyamanan;1
 Bar was very disappointing For the price should have been provided with Dressing Gowns Terrace with pool was ok but limited space and views were not great;kenyamanan;1
 Bathroom not as clean as I d expect for a kenyamanan star hotel Only enough milk for one person to have one coffee Only one coffee sachet per person ;kenyamanan;1
 be aware that booking taxi s using hotel to order it attracts a booking fee which was more than our taxi ride fare Would have been nice if they warned us about the fee before booking one for us ;kenyamanan;1
 Booked a double room got a twin with beds pushed together Not ideal for a romantic city break ;kenyamanan;1
 Booked a double room only one breakfast was included argued about thus but had to pay fir second breakfast then had to leave mist if it because we had to get the taxi to the airport ;kenyamanan;1
 Breakfast and evening meals very expensive and as a result restaurant empty other than at lunch time which affected the atmosphere of hotel It would have been nice to have dined there ;kenyamanan;1
 Breakfast arrangements and service a bit casual ;kenyamanan;1
 Breakfast brought to table too much and seemed wasteful;kenyamanan;1
 Breakfast could be improved a bit;kenyamanan;1
 Breakfast didn t start until 7 keamanankenyamanan Later some mornings Not ideal for a business traveler needing to get across town for early meetings Yes they do occur in Spain ;kenyamanan;1
 breakfast expensive so we ate locally instead;kenyamanan;1
 Breakfast is not so good It is not buffet You order from menu ;kenyamanan;1
 Breakfast is not worth kebersihan8 ;kenyamanan;1
 Breakfast is not worth this money hotel asks eggs in ten varieties not for a kenyamanan stars hotel ;kenyamanan;1
 Breakfast is offered but it is expensive as they charge kebersihan8 5kenyamanan euros per person ;kenyamanan;1
 Breakfast is overpriced but let s face it it s more or less the same price in other hotels I checked in that area ;kenyamanan;1
 Breakfast is pricey at that room price would be nice if it were included ;kenyamanan;1
 Breakfast should start at 7 kenyamanankenyamanan AM and I prefer a buffet rather than ordering off the menu We would have liked to had breakfast at the hotel on the day of departure but we had to leave by 8 kenyamanankenyamanan and the 7 keamanankenyamanan start didn t allow time since we had to order the food ;kenyamanan;1
 Breakfast was a bit pricey not a big deal because of the many great options right outside ;kenyamanan;1
 Breakfast was average for the orice;kenyamanan;1
 Breakfast was expensive so we didn t have it But lots of options near by so no bother ;kenyamanan;1
 Breakfast was good but pricey ;kenyamanan;1
 Breakfast was good plenty of choice but expensive ;kenyamanan;1
 Breakfast was overprotect;kenyamanan;1
 Breakfast was too expensive for us as we only wanted a coffee and croissant Parking is also very expensive at keamanankenyamanan per day although the car park does provide a secure location We were in room keamanankebersihan9 which was just above a motorbike parking zone and therefore very noisy in the early morning It was the Christmas period and the restaurant was closed and the bar staff were often difficult to locate ;kenyamanan;1
 Breakfasts should have available earlier than 7 keamanankenyamanan when it was very crowded More staff at breakfast would have been better ;kenyamanan;1
 Building work ongoing so noisy at times and restaurant not available other than breakfast Bar was frequently unattended so getting snacks drinks sometimes took a little more effort than expected Facilities were OK but it s the location you re really paying for Free wifi is a plus but the signal was typically poor unless in the hotel lobby ;kenyamanan;1
 Check in and Check out clerk goatee beard abrupt and disinterested Other reception staff better The most disappointing hotel in two weeks Maybe tourist fatigue ;kenyamanan;1
 Chocolate from minibar expired kenyamanan months;kenyamanan;1
 Coffee at breakfast was lukewarm everyday;kenyamanan;1
 Coffee facilities in the room were a bonus but they were never restocked which was a shame;kenyamanan;1
 Continental breakfast offered had to pay for full breakfast when we had paid for breakfast with our booking;kenyamanan;1
 could do with more tea coffee cups were not cleaned not enough milk forgot pillow cases after cleaning room;kenyamanan;1
 could have been cheaper;kenyamanan;1
 Could have been more breakfast or menu options ;kenyamanan;1
 could not make appropriate reservations online to visit important sites;kenyamanan;1
 Could not use the shower and three different staff suggested different ways of fixing it and none of them worked had to use the bath apart from that it was all ok ;kenyamanan;1
 could of done with a bit more storage as drawers;kenyamanan;1
 Did not like the smell in the lobby Carpeting and rug in lobby needs to be replaced Need more help at the bar ;kenyamanan;1
 didn t have any views;kenyamanan;1
 Don t think anything could have been better Bed was super Bathroom was very well fitted and had lots of quality toiletries ;kenyamanan;1
 Due to the location and it being a very touristy area we had heard that pickpocketing was very common in that area We didn t experience this ourselves however ;kenyamanan;1
 During our kerapihan days stay there was no Internet connexion on our foor ;kenyamanan;1
 Everything was easy I was happy as a tea drinker with the hot water kettle but my niece who is a coffee drinker only had instant coffee or as we called it water coffee ;kenyamanan;1
 Everything was perfect Couldn t fault this place ;kenyamanan;1
 Everything was perfect We didn t have breakfast at the hotel too expensive but it s a very nice cafe just next door;kenyamanan;1
 Expensive breakfast Room had very little bathroom counter area No drawers to unpack smaller luggage items ;kenyamanan;1
 Expensive to eat in the hotel ;kenyamanan;1
 Explanation of how room electricity works;kenyamanan;1
 Extra pillows were hard to come by had to request three times The instructions for the room safe were incomplete so it took a long time to figure out how to use them ;kenyamanan;1
 Facilities in room were fine but really more like an adequate keamanan star than a posh kenyamanan star i e expensive for what it is but then Barcelona accomodation generally is expensive and location could not have been better ;kenyamanan;1
 First room leaking sink moved to another room which had a bad electrical outlet sparked when I plugged in the light Front desk wasn t much help ;kenyamanan;1
 Food delivered to hotel room was lacklustre ;kenyamanan;1
 Food was a bit pricey;kenyamanan;1
 For me there wasn t anything to dislike I was in my elimant staying here ;kenyamanan;1
 Free water in rooms Also to be able to get a coffee later in the evenings kebersihankenyamanan keamanankenyamananish ;kenyamanan;1
 Free water in the room would have been nice ;kenyamanan;1
 Gym was very small and not a lot of equipment;kenyamanan;1
 Hard floors in room are uncomfortable in bare feet and next to bed I dropped my water glass at night which broke into many pieces Street outside window a bit noisy but it s a trade off with that great central location ;kenyamanan;1
 Hotel was great but some issues with a couple of fellow guests on our floor who let their kids run riot in the corridor and we re smoking in their room which we smelt as soon as we opened our bedroom door;kenyamanan;1
 I could easily say nothing but in order to be helpful The restaurant was closed during August which we did not know beforehand Overpriced breakfast we were room only and ate out well for less than half the price No dry white wine sinful and unimaginative snacks with drinks ;kenyamanan;1
 I didn t like coming back to the room at kerapihanpm and finding it still being cleaned I would have expected it to have been cleaned by then Also when we were then asked by the cleaner to give her 5 minutes to which we consented she then complained in Spanish on the phone to whoever she was speaking that she now only had 5 minutes to clean the room ;kenyamanan;1
 I didn t like the birds in the pool nobody wants to swim in the pool ;kenyamanan;1
 I don t have any complaints Maybe that there wasn t many English channels on the tv but that didn t really matter cause we didn t watch much tv Or that most cabs won t drop off at hotel they ask if they can drop you off in front of the cathedral but that didn t really matter to us but it s only a kerapihan min walk No biggie ;kenyamanan;1
 I felt it was expensive for what it is which whilst very good does lack that edge The extractor in the bathroom didn t work the rainshower shower head was loose the oversized light in front of the mirror in the bathroom completely obscured me when I was drying my hair Pointless addition Too few coat hangers no drawer space Having forgotten all about the small bottle of water my wife and I shared on arrival I was dissappointed that having paid out kebersihan5kenyamanankenyamanan for the room the hotel saw fit to make a claim on my credit card for kerapihan kenyamanankenyamanan seems petty ;kenyamanan;1
 I left the suggestion to put on slip material in tub shower ;kenyamanan;1
 I like a view but not possible often in a city hotel;kenyamanan;1
 I normally book 5 hotels because of the service they provide I however booked this hotel based on the reviews it had received on booking com which were super positive I must say I do not think paying keamanankenyamanankenyamanan per night breakfast for a room at this hotel is money worth while So the reviews did not live up to my expectations You pay for the location everything else is just ok Breakfast was really average It was also very time consuming to organize a taxi pick up at the airport The hotel never reverted to my initial request and I had to reach out again to them and the email I got was in bad English and very unclear as to how transportation is arranged I had to call them to sort it out The hotel collaborates with VIP taxi company which is very slow in responding and clearly has no urgency to respond to client requests I ended up spending too much time on something that normally gets dealt with in an emsil I am used to better service and will next time choose a hotel that provides that ;kenyamanan;1
 I notified management on the first day that the phone in the room was not working they said they would fix it but nothing was done about it during my keamanan day stay Also the safety deposit box was broken and unusable ;kenyamanan;1
 I wanted to watch the Australian Open tennis but could not because of the limited cable channels But that s usually the way it is in Spanish hotels ;kenyamanan;1
 I was moving to another room and left something in my former room staff threw out my things without moving them to the new room ;kenyamanan;1
 I was surprised that it had received such good reviews Lots of small things weren t quite up to scratch and the room was noisy ;kenyamanan;1
 I was under the impression breakfast was included Also l thought it was misleading about the amount of payment to you The first payment said the amount including v a t total Then further on another page it added tax The consequences were my holiday was more expensive than I thought Though I enjoyed it turned out more expensive and l had less spending money I think you should have made the overall price more clear ;kenyamanan;1
 I wish I could have stayed for longer ;kenyamanan;1
 I wish it was completely smoke free particularly noted around the swimming pool;kenyamanan;1
 I would suggest family with kids avoid as the pool area is quite small Definitely a stop if your a couple however;kenyamanan;1
 If only the outdoor rooftop swimming pool could have been heated for late October evening swimming;kenyamanan;1
 If you are walking there it is a little hard to find the first time since it is not on a main street ;kenyamanan;1
 In a hotel of that category the shower shampoo stuff was abysmal The shampoo smelled like the cheapest stuff in a 6kenyamanans barber shop there was NO repeat no if anyone could not believe that moisturiser in a city where the weather and the amount of crowds demand a shower about three times a day ;kenyamanan;1
 inability to boil a kenyamanan minute egg lol very noisy neighbours on one night not hotels fault ;kenyamanan;1
 Incentives to visit particular facilities would have been nice Not anything large but perhaps 5 kebersihankenyamanan off as promos to visit ;kenyamanan;1
 It says pool avaible through all year but went there in the last day and was very dirty but the rest was fine ;kenyamanan;1
 it was all good no issues;kenyamanan;1
 It was slippy to take a shower in thr bathtub ;kenyamanan;1
 It wasn t a bad experience but we thought that the hotel s stinginess over milk tea coffee sachets was poor When I asked if we could have milk from the cafe we were charged kerapihan for a glassful ;kenyamanan;1
 It would have been nice to have a few drawers Also for someone elderly it might be hard to get out of the shower ;kenyamanan;1
 Just a few minor things the room was a little expensive but you pay for the location The bed was a little uncomfortable if you sat back against the pillows the mattress slid down the pillows were a bit soft and not supportive just my preference though There was no extractor fan in the bathroom so it got very steamed up ;kenyamanan;1
 lack of seats to pause a little at the Picasso museum for us oldies ;kenyamanan;1
 Lack of view from our room but we were not in there much so didn t really matter;kenyamanan;1
 Lacked places to store clothing and other travel items No drawers which may be good as things cannot be left behind Well designed but nowhere to set a second suitcase Limited hangers Shower was great but needed easy instructions to operate Asked for a bathmat as tub was slick as in new Once acquainted with European electricity savers liked the use of room card to turn on and off all electricity A little tricky at first ;kenyamanan;1
 Lacks a bit of character if that s something you re looking for ;kenyamanan;1
 Liked everything location clean friendly staff;kenyamanan;1
 Liked the food but eggs needed to be cooked more Add more variety especially if staying more than kenyamanan 5 days;kenyamanan;1
 Lobby wasn t very appealing but that didn t really matter Room was very basic but again for the location this was great ;kenyamanan;1
 Loved it all Would gladly return ;kenyamanan;1
 lower price;kenyamanan;1
 Lunch is not worth the effort eat lunch elsewhere ;kenyamanan;1
 Maintenance in some small points not perfect but immediate support ;kenyamanan;1
 Maintenance staff does not speak English so you have to connect thru the reception which leads to some misunderstandings and delays but all ends well with much good will ;kenyamanan;1
 My only disappointment was the fact that our hot water wasn t working probably and it took kenyamanan full days to fix We had to show someone from the staff what we meant There was plenty of hot water going into the bath but only cold water would flow from the rain shower it was very weird They only offered us breakfast as compensation twice We had to keep complaining We found this a bit poor Otherwise the staff were helpful and knowledge ;kenyamanan;1
 Myself any my husband felt sorry for the waiter at breakfast every morning He was rushed off his feet looking after a number of guests alone There was a manger there but did not help once at taking an order for the duration of our breakfast Room was comfortable but noisy Lots of shouting in the corridor The guy at reception on check out did not even ask how was our stay Just printed bill and said goodbye No interaction whatsoever Paying over 5kenyamanankenyamanan in January for a couple of nights is expensive and a little more customer service would have been nice ;kenyamanan;1
 N a everyone was helpful No issues ;kenyamanan;1
 Needs air conditioning;kenyamanan;1
 Ni A;kenyamanan;1
 No air conditioning in our room and it got a little warm for us in February We had a rollaway bed brought in for our daughter which made the room very tight to get around but it was fine because we were only there at night to sleep ;kenyamanan;1
 No ambiance and nowhere comfortable to sit and have a drink The terrace is not inviting at all in May ;kenyamanan;1
 No bad experiences Would be nice to have a bar on the roof pool area Although we found rooms very comfortable could you use alittle freshening up;kenyamanan;1
 No bedside cabinets for smalls ;kenyamanan;1
 No body lotion in the bathroom The safe did not work Made a couple of calls but it did eventually get fixed ;kenyamanan;1
 No complaints delighted with the hotel;kenyamanan;1
 no do not disturb signs in room to put on door handle ;kenyamanan;1
 No drawers in the cupboards to put clothes in;kenyamanan;1
 No evening restaurant;kenyamanan;1
 No fan in bathroom very poor quality toiletries Sink splashing significantly Bathroom not well thought out ;kenyamanan;1
 No free internet The shower a bit tricky;kenyamanan;1
 No hand soap to wash your hands nowhere to put your gels under the shower nothing to clean the toilets no real privacy in the toilets as the sliding door remains a bit opened I feel the designer of the place forgot to stay there once ;kenyamanan;1
 No restaurant in the evening I would have liked a bit more comfort in the public areas;kenyamanan;1
 No restaurant open for evening meals;kenyamanan;1
 No restaurant service in the evening No proper beer glasses had to have large wine glasses;kenyamanan;1
 No we really did not have anything to complain about during our stay ;kenyamanan;1
 Noise from another roon untill keamananam Tea and coffee not replaced every day Bank account debited for items not taken from minibar after our departure Check your bank account on return home Hotel have said they will refund me but how often does this happen and people dont notice ;kenyamanan;1
 Noisey at night;kenyamanan;1
 Noisy hallway in the mornings due to cleaning ladies Hair on newly placed bath towels ;kenyamanan;1
 Not complete amenities in the room no slipper ;kenyamanan;1
 Not enough drawers or shelves to place you garments to unpack your suitcase;kenyamanan;1
 Not enough space provided for clothing Noise from room above caused by chairs etc being moved around on the wooden floors early morning Restaurant closed at 5pm ;kenyamanan;1
 Not enough staff to serve at peak breakfast times;kenyamanan;1
 Not really clean water in the pool lots of bird droppings ;kenyamanan;1
 Not that it is a big deal but the a c was not working and there was some confusion about the fan we requested but all in all it worked out fine I would have liked breakfast to be included again no problem as there were plenty of places to eat it is just me ;kenyamanan;1
 Not updating toiletries on a daily basis;kenyamanan;1
 nothing All went well thank you ;kenyamanan;1
 nothing it was fantastic;kenyamanan;1
 Nothing negative to say about this hotel and location ;kenyamanan;1
 Nothing really Everything was great ;kenyamanan;1
 Nothing really to fault If there had been a bar next to the rooftop pool that would have been superb but it s not an issue ;kenyamanan;1
 Nothing special Soundproof is little poor and closet is minimum but they are not problem ;kenyamanan;1
 Nothing specific except the bad weather;kenyamanan;1
 Nothing the hotel was great ;kenyamanan;1
 Nothing the stay was perfect ;kenyamanan;1
 nothing to complain aboutLocation ideal for si;kenyamanan;1
 offered breakfast too expensive also safe in room did not work pricy mini bar in room and not enough coffee left for coffee maker in room ;kenyamanan;1
 old decor needs upgrade to charge such high rate;kenyamanan;1
 On Arrival after a long trip we made a cup of tea When phoning for the wifi code we requested more tea bags we had just used our kerapihan allocated to the room A gentleman arrived from reception with kenyamanan in his hand and advised that these would incur an additional charge and be added to the bill I told him that after paying keamanankenyamanankenyamanan for the hotel room for keamanan days you are going to charge me for a tea bag Needless to say out of principle I told him to forget it I would purchase some in a small mini market After kerapihankenyamanan mins he returned and advised we could keep the tea but if we ask for more we would be charged Though it was the only negative as the hotel is perfectly located and comfortable it started the visit in this hotel on a bad footing ;kenyamanan;1
 On the whole a very good experience only criticism would be price of breakfast if taken However next door is an excellent little cafe very modern and just a couple of euro for coffee and croissant ;kenyamanan;1
 One night there was something going on outside and it was very noisy and hard to sleep;kenyamanan;1
 One of the light bulbs were out in the bathroom and the hairdryer overheated when only used for a short time ;kenyamanan;1
 One of the reception staff had poor english and coudn t answer to me easy questions ;kenyamanan;1
 Only kerapihan milks left for complimentary tea coffee We had to keep asking for more ;kenyamanan;1
 only tiny complaint was that the tv had to be paid for fair enough with films etc but we thought you should at least have access to the news for no charge;kenyamanan;1
 Our room was next to the elevator so a bit loud in the early morning and late evening ;kenyamanan;1
 Our room was pleasant but was rather cold and the air conditioning did not seem to make any difference ;kenyamanan;1
 Our room was shabby Wardrobe doors had dropped and didn t move easily or shut no extractor fan in bathroom No view ;kenyamanan;1
 Our shower was broken but they offered to give us another room;kenyamanan;1
 Our stay was great but had a little issue with the temperature of the room We stayed on the hotel in early March with the high temps around 65 F kebersihan7 C but when we initially walked into our room it was about 85 F kerapihan9 C We turned off the heat but we still had to keep our window open the entire keamanan day stay so it was a little noisy at night The hotel is in a busy area with lots of noise in the street sidewalk but not sure if it would have been noisy with the window shut ;kenyamanan;1
 Overpriced breakfast at hotel but easy to find good breakfasts nearby ;kenyamanan;1
 Pillows in room could be better;kenyamanan;1
 Pillows not comfortable No extractor fan in bathroom Hairdryer in bathroom;kenyamanan;1
 Pool could ve been cleaner full of bird poo ;kenyamanan;1
 Pool was cold;kenyamanan;1
 Pool was small breakfast was very expensive so went coffee shop next door ;kenyamanan;1
 Pool way too cold Would be much nicer with a little heating unbearable Reception very confused with the fact we paid prior to stay which mean they tried to charge us twice and I had to produce bank statements to prove I paid even though I had confirmation of payment from Booking com ;kenyamanan;1
 Poor cocktail bar staff Training required for cocktails Lets start with Martini Cocktail Hotel Colon can do it ;kenyamanan;1
 Poor information in rooms on how things work tv channels restaurant hours and similar;kenyamanan;1
 Poor spanish construction no sound insulation so we were disturbed by drunk clients keamanan kenyamanan time a night ;kenyamanan;1
 Prefer not to have to step into bath for shower but it was fine ;kenyamanan;1
 Price a little high but it is in the center of things ;kenyamanan;1
 Prices in the hotel bar were more expensive than the mini bar ;kenyamanan;1
 Quite old style hotel;kenyamanan;1
 Really cannot think of a thing that we did not like about the hotel ;kenyamanan;1
 Refuse collected every night in the early hours of the morning A few late night revellers heading home but the road outside is very quiet and virtually traffic free Lots of scooters parked on it but never actually heard any of them leave ;kenyamanan;1
 Restaurant has very little atmosphere Main Course was fine ;kenyamanan;1
 Restaurant is also very good with delicious food but has very strange working hours kebersihankerapihan kebersihan7pm are exactly the time span when we don t need the hotel s restaurant cause we are strolling out in the city Anyway there are a lot of restaurants nearby to get some good food at any time Sound proofing is not good We heard everything from the hall much too well People from adjacent rooms could be heard too if they got louder than usual ;kenyamanan;1
 Restaurant recomendations ;kenyamanan;1
 Roof top pool a bit small Would be nice if reception area has air con ;kenyamanan;1
 Room cleaned around kenyamanan pm but it was not a big problem ;kenyamanan;1
 Room lighting could be stronger ;kenyamanan;1
 Room needs to be dusted Everyday I can c dust on the phone cups r still stained from coffee amienties r not replaced Everyday upon checked in my desk r filled with dust including the coffee cups n kettle;kenyamanan;1
 Room overlooked rear of buildings quite noisy late at night when people are in the outside drinks area ;kenyamanan;1
 Room temperature runs a bit warm but considering all the pluses this is very minor ;kenyamanan;1
 Room temperature was too hot even with lowest setting Needed better air con Swimming pool was freezing cold and barely usable But overall an excellent hotel ;kenyamanan;1
 Room was a little spartan There was no comfortable chair and insufficient drawer space ;kenyamanan;1
 Room was good but could have been sound proofed more as you could hear the neighbours Toilet tank moved and banged against the wall every time toilet used I have never stayed in a hotel where only kebersihan teabag kebersihan coffee sachet left for each guest and kebersihan milk which contained a teaspoon of milk which is why I need at least keamanan per cup One day we were left without any The air con only blew out warm air on the lowest setting so it was left off as I found the room warm I would not be able to use this hotel in the summer as I would bake A few alterations could make your stay much more enjoyable and it s all achievable Brother was pick pocketed on our first night but luckily ran him down and got his wallet back Amazing as he has bad knees must have been the adrenaline This happened directly outside hotel when getting in to a taxi Unfortunately Hotel not that interested when notified that this happened on their door step which was a bit disappointing Beware they are everywhere and you can actually spot a lot of them ;kenyamanan;1
 Room was hot and air conditioning noisy and ineffective Swimming pool on the roof was too cold to swim in on sunny days in April ;kenyamanan;1
 Room was not very big;kenyamanan;1
 Room was rather noisy Outside noise could be heard as well as noise from adjoining rooms and passageway ;kenyamanan;1
 Room was small with lack of storage;kenyamanan;1
 Room was too hot at night as the air conditioning was not available which was disappointing It was not possible to sleep with the window open as it was too noisy outside ;kenyamanan;1
 Rooms are very average In room service costs extra not the best thing for any hotel View from the room is that of some not so good looking apartments ;kenyamanan;1
 Rooms felt a little small No drawers Not enough staff at breakfast at busy times Really wanted to love this hotel but didn t but can t quite put my finger on why Would I stay there again Probably ;kenyamanan;1
 rooms on the lower floors subject to some street noise even though it is not on a main street Overall relatively quiet for centrally located ;kenyamanan;1
 Rooms were pretty small but comfortable and clean ;kenyamanan;1
 Seriously nothing significant to complain about It s a super hotel We ve added it to our repeat list ;kenyamanan;1
 service from some staff members could have been better it felt like you were being troublesome if you asked for anything Info at the hotel said the bar stayed open till kebersihankerapihanpm on Saturday but it closed at kebersihankebersihanpm but nobody came to tell us and we were sitting in the bar ;kenyamanan;1
 Service in the bar was slow at times ;kenyamanan;1
 Service of snacks in the lobby could be better had to go on the hunt for staff However they were very prompt with pool orders and were good in the bar Other than that no issues at all ;kenyamanan;1
 Shower a bit complicated to use at first Some instructions should be left in the bathroom on how to use the shower ;kenyamanan;1
 Shower didn t work properly didn t get fixed Staff did not advise of the facilities available to us I E Swimming pool not sure that Catedral is best value for money;kenyamanan;1
 Shower pressure is a bit low ;kenyamanan;1
 Sink looks lovely but unsafe easy to bang head on tap mixer no soap holder in bath would prefer kerapihan bedside lockers with storage ;kenyamanan;1
 Slippers cost extra charge Room at the rate of kebersihan95 night didn t even included breakfast Minibar items in the refrigerator were not clean ;kenyamanan;1
 Slow Breakfast service;kenyamanan;1
 smell of humidity in corridor and room;kenyamanan;1
 Softer outside seating would make the garden area more inviting to use particularly in the evening No bar area by pool;kenyamanan;1
 Some if the reception staff don t smile and unfriendly;kenyamanan;1
 Some noise from nearby building site but unavoidable;kenyamanan;1
 Some taxi drivers don t know how to get into the immediate area the Hotel is located in and we were dropped off in the Square and had to walk 5kenyamananmetres to the Hotel This was not the Hotel s fault I must add ;kenyamanan;1
 sometimes a little noisy being central the city can be lively at night Less expensive breakfasts or meals in the hotel however plenty of choice in the area;kenyamanan;1
 Sound insulation between room and bathroom not good and could also hear some noise from adjacent room Couldn t get the air con to blow out anything other than hot air although it wasn t particularly hot during our stay so opening the window was fine ;kenyamanan;1
 Staff wasn t overly helpful They should be more helpful In giving suggestions for food shopping sights etc Seemed inconvenienced Actually was recommended A place took a cab and place didn t open until midnight and it was only kebersihankenyamananpm Poor information that cost kenyamanankenyamanan euros for nothing;kenyamanan;1
 Staff were not informative needed to ask for information as it was not freely given On arrival had to ask about our rooms and where they were not told about the gym and lovely roof top area also no one to greet us at breakfast and show us where to sit ;kenyamanan;1
 Staff were simply not particularly friendly or helpful the lifts were exceptionally slow and the roof pool was quite small with no bar service ;kenyamanan;1
 staying there longer ;kenyamanan;1
 Strange restaurant hours but again really not an issue kind of forces you to experience the city which is great;kenyamanan;1
 Streetlight flooded the room at night because there are no blackout curtains The bath water is a preset temperature which is too cool to stay in the bath longer than five minutes ;kenyamanan;1
 Surpress the street noise heavier curtains etc;kenyamanan;1
 Swimming pool not maintained presumably seasonal but some of us may enjoy a cold swim ;kenyamanan;1
 Taxi driver dropped us off at a semi circle and pointed to somewhere where to find the hotel so at first a bit hard to find Once found easy to get to ;kenyamanan;1
 Taxi drivers getting lost trying to find the hotel Soulless reception and exterior Unfriendly unhelpful staff it appeared understaffed Collecting and returning towel for rooftop pool to reception Would seem much more logical to have them available at the pool The towels looked a bit past their best too ;kenyamanan;1
 Taxi maneuvers could be a little difficult because of the location along with road closures and other city events The desk will call a cab however on a day when cabs were not so plentiful we waited over kerapihankenyamanan minutes for the cab to come with no luck The desk staff suggested to go out to a nearby street where there was a cab stand We re well traveled and live in cities were you hail cabs so we did that and had cab in just a minute or two on a very busy day There was another couple that couldn t walk that far so that wouldn t have been good for them ;kenyamanan;1
 The A C was off and therefore the air in the room was stale dry and too warm The management told us the A C would be off during the winter months so we would have to open the window if we wanted fresh air The problem with that is the noisy neighborhood partying through the night also during weekdays mixed with the loud garbage collectors and traffic noise making it impossible to sleep with the window open ;kenyamanan;1
 The air con didn t seem to work that great and some nights could get quite stuffy But as a whole was impressed and happy with the hotel ;kenyamanan;1
 The air con in our room wasn t brilliant but it was fine in our friends room ;kenyamanan;1
 The air con the flushing of toilet bowl the noise along corridor ;kenyamanan;1
 the air condition was not working as it should ;kenyamanan;1
 The air conditioner didn t seem to be cooling properly in the room ;kenyamanan;1
 The air conditioning unit in our room failed with a serious leak in the early hours of the first night Saturday to Sunday but see What did you like ;kenyamanan;1
 The area outside the hotel seems to be a popular gathering point for socializing and partying If you are a light sleeper ask for a quiet room ;kenyamanan;1
 The bar closed at kerapihankeamanankenyamanankenyamanan and on returning to hotel at kerapihankerapihankenyamanankenyamanan the person on the bar refused to make a cocktail offering only beer or gin as an alternative ;kenyamanan;1
 The bar closing at kebersihankebersihanpm ;kenyamanan;1
 The bathroom window didn t open ;kenyamanan;1
 The breakfast could be improved in terms of variety and quality of the products ;kenyamanan;1
 The breakfast is too expensive The door to our room didnt shut properly You had to force it ;kenyamanan;1
 The breakfast just ok;kenyamanan;1
 The breakfast service was a little disorganized Feels like they need some training as they were not equipped to handle the morning rush ;kenyamanan;1
 The choice during breakfast is very limited and not all waiters known English well which leads to misunderstandings and they bring you something you haven t ordered ;kenyamanan;1
 The closet doesn t have shelf;kenyamanan;1
 The coffee didn t realise you had expres until we had been there several days ;kenyamanan;1
 The fact that my friends had paid less by not booking with booking com Foyer seemed a little tired ;kenyamanan;1
 The fact that there are on going heavy works at the ground floor restaurant during peak season couped with the fact that we were not informed in advance was a let down The above is a sign that the hotel shareholders should perhaps look into the operation management and marketing dept and check their motivation levels Both depts show lack of interest and enthusiasm as in my opinion they should have kebersihan planned and executed these works during winter time kerapihan offer a discount to their guests or a free dinner at a restaurant or some additional perks as a compensation On the other hand the reception desk seem to be working struggling on their own without any help from management In our kenyamanan days there I never once saw any manager walking the job there ;kenyamanan;1
 The front desk staff could have been friendlier;kenyamanan;1
 The gym and pool was small but hey at least it had one The staff didn t speak great English but they understood enough to help you out ;kenyamanan;1
 The Gym needs more equipment A little bit of investment is needed;kenyamanan;1
 The heating cooling system needs to be updated No heat or air from 9 at night till 9 am ;kenyamanan;1
 The hotel doesn t have much food options inside;kenyamanan;1
 The hotel locks the main door sometime after midnight one night during our stay we returned late and it took a while for the door to be opened to let us in View from the room was pretty poor but it didn t spoil our stay The air conditioner didn t cool the air just recirculated it Breakfast was pricey at kebersihan8 per head so ate out and got good value at local caf s ;kenyamanan;1
 The hotel printed out my card details EVERYTHING Even my CVV number Then they put it in an unlocked drawer with other people s card info When I questioned them I was met with ridicule since they have been doing this for a long time Well just bc you have been doing this for a long time it does not mean that it is the right way to do it They violated privacy policies On the last day we asked them to destroy the paper that had my card details Someone could buy sg really nice on the internet with all those card info Btw I ve notified my bank too ;kenyamanan;1
 The hotel was a little noisy at times during the night due to bin collections and street cleaning but this would affect any hotel in the city centre ;kenyamanan;1
 The inclusive breakfast lacked variety ;kenyamanan;1
 The internet went down while I was there for the best part of a day not the hotel s fault but it affected the hotel s payment system too so checking out was a bit of a pain Not sure whether this is regular occurrence or not Ignore any taxi driver that tells you he has to drop you off on the main street and that you will have to lug your own suitcase for five minutes across the pedestrian area in front of the cathedral The hotel is on a side street but it is accessible by car I think my driver was just feeling lazy that day The pigeons enjoying the pool were a bit off putting Plus it was too cold to swim in already in early September All rooms are non smoking but there was a large and obvious cigarette burn on the comfy chair in my room This is all minor stuff and not necessarily within the hotel s control however I think it s a fabulous hotel ;kenyamanan;1
 The lack of tea coffee and sugar was very disappointing There was NO choice of teas no decaffeinated option and only two small cartoons of milk each day We requested extra milk etc but this was not dealt with well We have travelled extensively and have never experienced this A small thing but this was the only issue that spoiled an otherwise enjoyable stay ;kenyamanan;1
 The lighting in the room is really terrible The room had a large window kerapihan of them but it was not enough light There should be more light available on the desk and also at the bedside one side really had only a small light ;kenyamanan;1
 The maid was a bit tight with leaving milk for tea we had to ring down to reception everyday we were there ;kenyamanan;1
 The only downside is the view from the rooms but it is compensated by other things ;kenyamanan;1
 The only issue was the lack of space for clothing there were not enough drawers ;kenyamanan;1
 The only thing I would have liked was if the room had kerapihan comfortable chairs to sit in The room was very large there was room for kerapihan chairs The bed was very comfortable and the room was very clean ;kenyamanan;1
 The patisserie next door It s way to convenient ;kenyamanan;1
 the pool is a bit small;kenyamanan;1
 the pool was not available during the short stay;kenyamanan;1
 The pool water could be filtered more often otherwise it s a great pool on top And the lounge music from it s courtyard plays all day and evening could me manages better even if it s not too loud it can be bothersome ;kenyamanan;1
 The poolside bar was disappointing ;kenyamanan;1
 The price of drinks or breakfast but there are plenty of small eateries or bars on the doorstop The kebersihankebersihanpm closing of the bar The wifi that only seemed to work in the bedroom would have been better if it worked by the pool as well;kenyamanan;1
 The price of the hotel is quite expensive The room size is great though This has been the dearest accommodation in all of our stays in Europe ;kenyamanan;1
 The reception common area could be improved we liked everything else We ate breakfast in the wonderful the cake shop right next door best coffee and wholewheat croissants in Spain;kenyamanan;1
 The restaurang;kenyamanan;1
 The restaurant here is closed on weekends but there are dozens of restaurants within a kebersihankenyamanan minute walk so it wasn t an issue for us ;kenyamanan;1
 The roof top with the pool was closed without any prior info supposedly due to pool maintenance for four days ;kenyamanan;1
 The rooftop pool was closed for the season which really is not the hotel s fault ;kenyamanan;1
 The rooftop swimming pool was used by birds for drinking water;kenyamanan;1
 The room could do with more places for clothes You can t get everything on 6 coat hangers ;kenyamanan;1
 The room was decorated in a urban modern design was very basic with the in room amenities and was lacking comfort and coziness ;kenyamanan;1
 The room was very hot when we arrived and took a few hours to get down to temperature The shower didn t have a shelf to put your toiletries on There was a taxi strike starting at kenyamanan6 kenyamanankenyamanan which meant that we had to leave at kenyamanan5 keamanankenyamanan to get to the train station when our train left at kenyamanan9 keamanankenyamanan not the hotels fault and they did put up notices in the lifts to say that the strike was happening ;kenyamanan;1
 The room was very warm when we first checked in ;kenyamanan;1
 the rooms are some badly soundproofed;kenyamanan;1
 The rooms need drawers to put clothes in It had good wardrobes mirrors and lights but nowhere to put your bits bobs And bedside cabinet is really low so awkward My wife s side of the bed had no cabinet but a piece of tree trunk trendy I m sure but not really functional Won t put me off though as we have already booked it again for next Christmas with Booking com;kenyamanan;1
 The rooms were extremely warm as the hotel could not turn on the AC until the winter season is officially over and that s when the central heating system will be switched to AC So we had to resort to the windows cracked open at night which meant we had to listen to the street noises until keamananam But the worst part was the incompetence of the Receptionists specifically Manuel who were not prepared at all to help with check out on the day of the marathon We happened to notice a discrete sign at the front desk and in the elevator that they put up the day before saying that all roads will be closed Very helpful when it came to us a family of keamanan one being an elderly person of 7kenyamanan and a child of 9 and four suitcases Finally after arguing with them all afternoon at 8 kenyamanankenyamananpm the restaurant manager offered to help us with the suitcases the next day so we could walk for a half hour around the marathon streets to get to our airport transportation We had been at the hotel for a whole week and they did not think once to tell us to prepare for this day even though they knew that my 7kenyamanan year old mother is with us an email I sent to them before checking in and that we were checking out on marathon day a yearly event which they have a whole year to plan for Disappointing ending to a delightful vacation ;kenyamanan;1
 The safe in my room was tricky I had to have help which was provided immediately It worked for kerapihan days but then the safe lost the code I did the reset procedure and It seemed to be locked but opened when I turned the knob the opposite direction I could not depend on it so I just carried everything with me the last kerapihan days Also the taxi could not drive to the hotel in the busy afternoon when I arrived so I had to find it on my own after a long flight But on leaving at keamananAM the taxi arrived at the door about kerapihan minutes after the call from the desk I had not yet signed my receipt ;kenyamanan;1
 The shampoo and conditioner smell Mattress was not comfortable at one part ;kenyamanan;1
 The shelves in the closet were moldy and occasionally one of the windows did not close properly Nora Jones was on repeat on the terrace The old Barcelona smell got in from time to time ;kenyamanan;1
 The shower did not work properly i could not switch it on the middle mode And i wanted to upgrade to have a friend stay with me i had a twin room but i was not allowed The explanation its our policy made me grumpy The breakfast is overpriced ;kenyamanan;1
 The shower head leaked over the bath screen ;kenyamanan;1
 The shower we had difficulty operating the shower and were unable to get any hot water however after informing reception this was rectified by the second day ;kenyamanan;1
 The soundproofing could be better we could hear the TV from the next room early in the morning The reception personel were very efficient business like but don t smile much ;kenyamanan;1

 A perfect location for St Pancras and King s Cross station only about 5kenyamanan yards from the hotel doors to the Eurostar Check in and even closer to King s Cross The fact that the hotel is not immediately next to the main road means that the rooms are nice and quiet with no noise at all heard from the lively bar on the ground floor and the quieter cocktail bar on the first floor We had a Couchette Room which although compact is fitted out to a very high standard and perfect for an overnight stay before onward travel by Eurostar A particularly nice touch was a pantry at the end of each floor with a further selection of complementary drinks confectionery and cakes ;kenyamanan;0

 This is our favourite hotel in London and we stay here whenever we come to this city It s location right next to St Pancras station makes it the best place to stay if you are arriving or departing on the Eurostar service Kings Cross Underground also being on the doorstep is central for all locations in the city although can be a bit of a pain if traveling from Heathrow on the Heathrow Express as you have to come from Paddington The rooms are great and the added touch of The Pantry on every floor makes it very special Thoroughly recommended ;kenyamanan;0

 The staff went to a great deal of trouble to sort out problems and offer me a room I would be happier with It is certainly very convenient for St Pancras station and the Eurostar terminal which is why I booked it in the first place as it is literally across the road The helpfulness of the staff and the cleanliness of the hotel did offset some of the problems I faced however I am not sure I would stay there again ;kenyamanan;0

 The absolute best part of this hotel was location It s located with one side attached to the King s Cross Station and across from St Pancras With Kings Cross St Pancras Underground having as many tube lines going through it as it does we found ourselves able to get almost any where in London with usually one line and never more than kerapihan Additionally Kings Cross has plenty of places to grab a quick bite to eat before enjoying the sites Although the room was not large by American standards it was spacious enough for two adults and two suitcases without us tripping over each other Considering the busy location with constant traffic in the area the hotel was absolutely silent We opened the window once and were amazed at how much noise the walls and windows were able to filter out Not a single siren penetrated the room of which there were plenty as I have experienced in many other city hotels Our favorite feature of the hotel was the pantry on each floor This had a Nespresso machine and tea kettle and was always kept clean and well stocked with coffee pods enough styles for everyone s tastes tea and a few tasty sweets pastry which was pleasant to start and end the day with The first floor also had a computing center with very easy to use wireless printers we sent something to print from our laptop in the kenyamananth floor room and were pleased to find it waiting for us as we left the hotel And on the laptop subject the WiFi was very reliable and faster even than what we have at home ;kenyamanan;0

 The fact that the reception staff did their best to ease us and were very sympathetic to our discovery of on going heavy works made our shock a it better It was obvious that it was NOT their fault To their credit they put us in rooms where we could not hear a single thump or any hammering so we soon forgot about our initial horror Once we were sorted everything run smoothly and we had a great and unforgettable time Generally all the reception staff were super cool and very customer oriented The management of the hotel should give them a bonus Especially the guy who had his aunt visiting and who warned us about the flight cancellations to Madrid He should be promoted ;kenyamanan;0

 This place was a surprise we expected it to be good and it was actually great There is no view here as there is at the Colon Hotel literally around the corner and which costs over 5kenyamanan EU per night more and at which we also stayed at the end of our trip BUT the reception was warm and welcoming and friendly They even provided us with a certificate for a free celebratory cocktail as our trip was celebrating an occasion The bed was very comfortable firm and the room had all the amenities one needs including working air conditioning The best part of this hotel is the free one hour walking tour of the Gothic Quarter provided by Olga an academic at the University Sundays and Wednesdays are her tours She knew so much about this history of the gothic quarter and had a wonderful and fascinating narrative prepared during the walking tour It was a highlight of our week and a half in this wonderful city I never got to the rooftop pool terrace so I can t comment on it There is a Thai restaurant across the street which we did not go to but the interior d cor looked beautiful but just a couple houses back from the Thai restaurant was a wonderful extremely casual tapas place There were many Spaniards there It wasn t elegant but the food was great and the rioja was fabulous and only kerapihan EU per glass This place felt authentic We went for a quick supper late at night two times but it isn t necessarily the place for an elegant meal ;kenyamanan;0
